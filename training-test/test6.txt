From
the
very
first
moment
of
her
return
to
the
vicarage
Ruth
was
caught
up
in
a
whirlwind
of
work
.
When
she
walked
in
at
the
back
door
Mrs
Peterson
said
:
"
You
're
back
then
.
Well
,
put
on
your
apron
.
You
're
just
in
time
to
make
a
bit
of
pastry
against
tomorrow
.
"
Ruth
supposed
it
was
Mrs
Peterson
's
way
of
taking
her
mind
off
the
sad
events
of
last
week
.
But
she
would
be
surprised
,
Ruth
thought
-
astounded
,
horrified
-
if
she
knew
what
other
thoughts
raced
in
her
young
servant
's
mind
,
if
she
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
vivid
memories
of
what
had
happened
with
Dick
Parker
.
Ruth
went
about
her
tasks
in
a
dream
,
but
her
preoccupied
state
was
naturally
attributed
to
grief
.
"
Only
two
weeks
now
to
the
mistress
's
confinement
,
"
Mrs
Peterson
reminded
her
.
"
Tomorrow
we
start
to
clean
through
the
house
,
top
to
bottom
.
So
it
's
up
with
the
lark
,
my
girl
!
"
She
spoke
as
if
Ruth
had
been
away
on
holiday
and
must
therefore
have
abounding
strength
and
energy
.
"
Florrie
will
be
worse
than
useless
,
"
Mrs
Peterson
continued
.
"
She
's
given
her
notice
to
leave
,
taken
a
living-in
job
in
Skipton
.
She
's
no
longer
interested
in
what
's
to
be
done
here
.
"
That
turned
out
to
be
true
.
Florrie
played
around
,
taking
twice
as
long
to
complete
every
task
.
She
was
full
of
talk
about
her
new
post
.
"
It
'll
be
a
sight
more
lively
than
here
,
"
she
said
.
"
There
's
plenty
going
on
i'
Skipton
.
"
"
There
's
enough
going
on
here
right
now
,
"
Ruth
told
her
sharply
.
"
I
'd
be
glad
of
a
bit
of
help
if
you
'd
condescend
to
give
it
.
"
Florrie
looked
at
Ruth
in
surprise
.
"
Hark
at
you
!
You
have
come
back
in
a
funny
mood
.
What
's
got
into
you
?
"
"
Oh
nothing
much
,
"
Ruth
retorted
.
"
Only
that
my
father
's
dead
,
my
stepmother
's
ill
,
and
I
'm
worried
sick
about
my
grandfather
!
Nothing
at
all
,
really
!
"
She
could
hardly
tell
Florrie
that
,
most
of
all
,
her
mind
was
on
Dick
.
He
had
already
gone
to
his
new
job
in
Wensleydale
,
with
a
promise
to
return
on
his
first
free
Sunday
.
Ruth
's
conscience
was
troubled
over
Dick
:
not
because
of
what
they
had
done
together
-
that
had
been
wonderful
and
whenever
she
thought
about
it
her
body
ached
,
her
breasts
tingled
with
longing
to
experience
it
again
-
but
because
she
now
knew
,
had
known
it
from
the
day
after
he
had
brought
her
home
,
that
he
was
not
the
man
she
wanted
to
marry
.
It
was
strange
that
a
sexual
union
which
left
nothing
to
be
desired
should
so
clarify
the
state
of
her
mind
.
And
still
,
and
yet
,
she
might
marry
him
.
She
had
not
totally
dismissed
the
idea
.
Married
to
Dick
,
she
would
be
able
to
give
her
grandfather
a
home
,
would
be
free
to
renew
that
wonderful
sexual
experience
as
often
as
she
wished
,
and
,
of
course
,
to
have
children
.
Unlike
Maria
,
Ruth
had
no
limit
in
her
mind
as
to
the
number
of
children
she
would
eventually
bear
.
It
shocked
her
that
she
could
make
such
a
cool
analysis
of
the
situation
.
That
alone
told
her
that
she
was
far
from
being
in
love
with
Dick
.
But
she
would
be
fair
.
When
the
time
came
for
decisions
she
would
not
deceive
him
.
If
she
agreed
to
marry
him
she
would
offer
him
what
she
could
-
affection
,
duty
,
loyalty
-
and
he
could
decide
whether
it
was
enough
.
"
Hard
work
drives
trouble
away
,
"
Mrs
Peterson
said
,
hearing
Ruth
's
exchange
with
Florrie
.
She
had
a
fund
of
such
sayings
,
but
this
time
she
was
proved
maddeningly
right
.
By
the
time
the
monthly
nurse
was
installed
once
again
,
and
Mrs
Longhill
was
delivered
of
her
second
child
-
a
daughter
,
to
be
named
Prudence
-
Ruth
had
almost
ceased
to
think
or
dream
about
anything
.
Getting
through
the
day
,
with
her
bed
at
the
end
of
it
the
only
goal
,
absorbed
all
her
energies
.
A
day
or
two
after
the
baby
's
birth
,
with
Mrs
Longhill
lying-in
and
the
nurse
making
more
work
than
the
rest
of
the
household
put
together
,
Florrie
left
.
"
We
've
no
sign
of
anyone
to
take
her
place
,
"
Mrs
Peterson
said
.
"
She
chose
to
go
at
a
very
inconvenient
time
,
I
must
say
"
They
were
to
have
a
full-time
,
living-in
servant
,
who
would
share
Ruth
's
bedroom
,
a
prospect
which
did
not
please
her
.
"
It
seems
there
are
no
servants
to
be
had
in
the
country
,
"
Mrs
Peterson
grumbled
.
"
I
ca
n't
understand
it
.
And
the
vicar
such
a
considerate
man
to
work
for
.
"
Fortunately
the
new
baby
thrived
.
She
took
the
breast
well
and
slept
at
night
without
the
drops
of
laudanum
with
which
the
nurse
had
dosed
the
infant
Benjamin
when
he
could
not
sleep
.
Benjamin
,
who
had
been
walking
for
a
month
,
found
himself
less
welcome
in
his
mother
's
room
and
followed
Ruth
around
the
house
like
a
pet
lamb
.
She
loved
him
more
than
ever
.
Ruth
herself
thrived
too
.
In
spite
of
all
the
hard
work
she
began
to
put
on
a
little
weight
.
"
You
're
getting
quite
mature
in
the
figure
,
"
Mrs
Peterson
remarked
.
"
Your
bust
is
filling
out
nicely
!
"
If
it
occurred
to
Ruth
-
and
how
could
it
possibly
occur
to
Mrs
Peterson
-
that
there
might
be
a
good
reason
for
this
,
she
dismissed
it
from
her
mind
at
once
.
It
was
true
that
she
had
missed
a
period
,
but
that
could
mean
anything
or
nothing
.
She
was
never
very
regular
.
She
was
not
sick
in
the
mornings
and
when
occasionally
nausea
swept
over
her
it
was
easily
put
down
to
fatigue
,
or
to
something
she
had
eaten
.
Her
mind
refused
to
believe
that
anything
could
happen
the
first
time
one
had
intercourse
.
"
Well
,
"
Mrs
Peterson
said
,
coming
into
the
kitchen
one
morning
a
few
days
after
the
monthly
nurse
had
left
,
"
you
'll
be
pleased
to
hear
that
the
mistress
has
found
a
new
servant
at
last
.
But
she
has
no
experience
so
I
do
n't
know
how
she
'll
make
out
.
"
Ellen
Hardcastle
turned
out
to
be
a
fourteen-year-old
wisp
of
a
girl
with
mousy
hair
and
pale
blue
eyes
.
She
came
from
"
over
the
hill
"
,
from
the
higher
part
of
Littondale
,
and
she
was
as
silent
as
her
native
dale
.
She
missed
her
family
badly
.
Getting
ready
for
bed
the
first
night
she
said
,
"
I
'm
glad
I
'm
sharing
your
room
,
Ruth
.
I
've
never
slept
on
my
own
afore
.
"
Ruth
had
n't
the
heart
to
tell
her
that
she
was
n't
welcome
in
it
.
In
fact
she
was
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
and
Ruth
hardly
knew
she
was
there
.
Later
on
she
had
good
reason
to
be
thankful
that
she
was
.
With
two
babies
in
the
house
Ruth
had
thought
,
as
Christmas
approached
,
that
there
would
not
be
much
entertaining
.
She
was
wrong
.
Early
in
December
Mrs
Longhill
actually
came
into
the
kitchen
to
discuss
with
Mrs
Peterson
the
refreshments
for
a
party
she
and
the
vicar
intended
to
give
.
"
We
must
remember
our
position
in
society
,
"
she
said
firmly
.
"
The
fact
that
we
have
now
been
blessed
with
two
little
ones
must
not
blind
us
to
our
obligations
,
nor
cause
us
to
lower
our
standards
.
"
She
spoke
,
Ruth
thought
,
as
if
she
were
the
mistress
of
a
large
establishment
in
London
instead
of
a
country
vicar
's
wife
in
a
remote
Yorkshire
dale
.
But
marriage
had
completely
changed
Miss
Caroline
.
There
was
nothing
left
of
the
friendship
they
had
known
in
Barnswick
.
They
were
simply
mistress
and
servant
now
"
What
she
means
,
"
Ruth
said
pertly
when
Mrs
Longhill
had
left
the
kitchen
,
"
is
that
her
servants
must
keep
up
the
standards
!
"
She
looked
at
the
three
of
them
:
an
old
woman
,
herself
not
yet
seventeen
,
and
a
raw
child
of
fourteen
.
"
Now
then
,
miss
!
"
Mrs
Peterson
reprimanded
.
"
Remember
your
place
!
"
But
throughout
December
it
was
they
who
slaved
away
-
or
at
least
Ruth
and
Ellen
did
.
Apart
from
being
disinclined
for
work
,
Mrs
Peterson
was
showing
her
age
more
than
ever
and
was
not
capable
of
sustained
effort
.
"
I
'm
handing
the
puddings
over
to
you
this
Christmas
Ruth
,
"
she
said
.
"
By
rights
they
should
have
been
made
on
Stir-up
Sunday
,
only
I
was
too
busy
.
Perhaps
we
should
say
the
collect
anyway
?
"
So
Ruth
made
the
rich
mixture
and
in
turn
the
three
of
them
stirred
it
,
reciting
meanwhile
the
collect
for
the
Sunday
before
Advent
.
"
Stir
up
we
beseech
Thee
,
O
Lord
,
the
wills
of
Thy
faithful
people
;
that
they
,
plenteously
bringing
forth
the
fruits
of
good
works
,
may
of
Thee
be
plenteously
rewarded
.
"
Ruth
added
her
own
silent
prayer
that
the
puddings
would
be
eatable
.
Since
her
father
's
death
she
had
written
regularly
to
her
grandfather
,
but
there
had
been
no
word
in
reply
from
Hester
.
She
had
also
written
to
Maria
,
reminding
her
of
her
promise
,
begging
for
news
,
but
when
Maria
at
last
replied
the
news
was
all
of
herself
,
nothing
of
Barnswick
.
"
To
my
infinite
regret
,
"
she
wrote
,
in
the
flowery
style
she
now
affected
,
"
I
have
been
quite
unable
to
visit
my
childhood
home
.
There
are
so
many
diversions
here
that
the
time
flies
by
on
wings
.
I
have
recently
been
to
a
performance
of
Mr
Handel
's
Messiah
and
,
would
you
believe
it
the
Second
West
Yorkshire
Yeomanry
is
to
hold
a
Regimental
Ball
in
the
New
Year
,
in
the
Exchange
Buildings
!
"
On
and
on
she
went
,
never
telling
Ruth
what
she
wanted
to
know
.
Her
only
real
news
at
this
time
came
from
Mrs
Longhill
.
"
My
father
tells
me
in
his
latest
letter
that
Hester
and
the
baby
are
doing
well
,
"
she
informed
Ruth
.
"
And
Grandfather
?
"
"
He
does
not
mention
your
grandfather
.
"
Afterwards
,
Ruth
could
not
remember
that
she
had
done
anything
unusual
on
the
twenty-third
of
December
.
She
and
Ellen
between
them
had
turned
out
the
dining-room
,
giving
it
extra
spit
and
polish
because
of
Christmas
.
When
they
went
to
bed
that
night
Ellen
,
as
usual
,
was
asleep
within
minutes
but
Ruth
,
though
deadly
tired
,
was
curiously
wakeful
;
not
quite
feeling
herself
but
not
able
to
put
a
finger
on
what
was
wrong
.
She
fell
asleep
at
last
,
but
in
no
time
at
all
the
pain
in
her
back
wakened
her
again
;
insistent
,
demanding
.
Even
before
she
had
come
to
,
it
rapidly
circled
her
belly
with
a
sharpness
which
made
her
cry
out
-
and
waken
Ellen
.
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
Ellen
sat
up
in
bed
,
rubbing
her
eyes
with
her
knuckles
like
a
sleepy
child
.
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
Ruth

Neither

understood
what
was
wrong
with

it
was
not
until
half-past
five
next
morning

the
doctor
at
last
arrived

that
a
name
was
put
to

had
been
urgently
summoned
by
the
sexton

the
vicar
had
sent
off
on

he
was
annoyed

being
dragged
from

early
on
Christmas

all
over

then

drenched
in
sweat

exhausted

Ruth
wanted

with
horror

face
drained
of
colour

She
swayed
on
her
feet

the

put
out
a
hand
to
steady
her

filled
with
a

The
week
which
followed
was
amongst
the
most
lonely
of
Ruth

life
.
Hardly
anyone
came
near
her
and
she
was
not
told
what
was
to
happen
.
With
the
vicar

views
on
hellfire
she
was
sure
she
would
not
go
unpunished
,
that
he
would
feel
obliged
to
deputise
for
God

it
was
clear
that
Mrs
Longhill
could
hardly
bear
to
talk
to
her

her
mistress
felt
it
her
duty
to
ask
certain
questions
.
"
Who

father

she
demanded

Ruth
said
nothing

She
had
not
decided
whether

not
to
tell
Dick
,
but
if
he
were
to
be
told
it
would
be
by
her
,
not
by
the
Longhills

Mrs

cried
.

Mrs

clutched
at
the
idea
.
"

grave

It
was
clear
to
Ruth
that
she
had
plumbed
the
depths
of
depravity
.
It
had
not
seemed
like
that
at
the
time
.
But
if
Mrs
Longhill
felt
better
that
her
servant
had
fallen
from
grace
in
distant
Barnswick
,
then
let
her
think
it
.
It
would
keep
Dick
out
of
the
picture
.
During
the
whole
of
Christmas
Day
Ruth
lay
on
her
back
in
bed
.
In
the
morning
she
heard
people
coming
to
church
,
and
she
wondered
about
Dick
.
He
would
have
Christmas
Day
off
and
he
would
surely
call
at
the
vicarage
on
some
pretext
or
other
.
What
would
they
tell
him
?
After
morning
service
,
when
the
last
of
the
footsteps
,
and
voices
exchanging
greetings
,
had
died
away
,
she
heard
the
vicar
ride
off
,
the
clip-clop
of
the
horse
's
hooves
as
clear
as
a
bell
on
the
cold
air
.
He
would
be
taking
Christmas
communion
to
the
sick
.
She
should
have
known
better
than
to
think
he
would
bring
it
to
her
,
miserable
sinner
that
she
was
.
For
her
Christmas
dinner
Ellen
brought
her
a
bowl
of
oatmeal
gruel
.
She
never
did
discover
how
the
puddings
turned
out
.
"

man

door

was
ever
so
sorry
not

he
wished
you

added
nervously

Mrs
Peterson
came
in
to
see
Ruth
just
the
once
.
"
How
could
you
do
this
to
the
vicar

"
she
demanded
.
"
And

season
like
this
,
too
,
with
all
his
extra
services
and
obligations

"
Ruth
was
tempted
to
tell
her
that
at
the
time
she
had
not
had
the
vicar
in
mind
,
but
since
Mrs
Peterson
had
not
come
to
bring
her
any
comfort
,
she
simply
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
.
The
housekeeper
left
the
room
,
muttering
about
ingratitude
.
On
the
thirtieth
of
December
the
doctor
called
again
and
pronounced
Ruth
fit
to
get
up
.
Though
she
felt
weak
,
it
was
good
to
be
dressed
again
.
She
was
ready
to
go
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
when
Ellen
came
into
the
room
.
"

As
Ellen
scurried
out
of
the
room
like
a
frightened
mouse
,
Ruth
sat
down
again
.
She
had
a
strange
,
dull
feeling
in
the
pit
of
her
stomach
.
What
was
happening
now
?
She
did
not
have
long
to
wait
.
Fifteen
minutes
later
Ellen
returned
,
looking
more
scared
than
ever
.
"
You
're
to
go
at
once

announced
.

said
coldly

Ellen
implored

her
eyes
filling
with
tears
.
When
Ruth
entered
the
study
the
vicar
was
sitting
at
his
desk
;
a
large
mahogany
desk
with
a
green
leather
top
,
which
Ruth
polished
with
loving
care
every
Wednesday
.
It
was
the
piece
she
liked
best
in
the
whole
house
.
He
did
not
raise
his
head
as
she
came
into
the
room
,
and
not
once
in
the
short
interview
which
followed
did
he
look
at
her
.
Instead
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
hands
,
which
were
clasped
together
on
the
desk
,
studying
them
as
if
the
words
he
must
say
were
written
on
his
bony
fingers
.
He
unclasped
them
just
long
enough
to
push
a
small
packet
across
the
desk
towards
Ruth
.
"
Here

wages

he
said
.
"

Ruth
took
a
step
forward
and
picked
up
the
packet
.
Her
instinct
,
almost
irresistible
,
was
to
throw
it
at
him
,
but
she
was
fast
learning
that
there
were
impulses
which
a
person
in
her
position
could
not
afford
to
follow
.
"

he
continued
in
his
dry
voice

you
dealt

cruelly
deceived

your

"
His
voice
was
smooth
,
cold
;
nothing
of
hellfire
in
it
.
Ruth
thought
she
would
have
preferred
it
if
he
had
shouted
at
her
.
"

asked
stupidly

innocent
children

charge

is

not
agree

cried
out

when
you
have
packed
you
will
wait
there
until
the
conveyance
arrives
.
"
When
he
had
finished
speaking
he
sat
there
silently
,
his
head
bowed
,
waiting
for
her
to
leave
.
She
could
not
move
.
The
shock
of
his
words
had
so
drained
what
little
strength
she
had
that
for
a
moment
she
was
powerless
to
take
even
one
step
.
"
That
is
all
,
"
the
vicar
said
.
And
then
a
swift
,
burning
anger
,
such
as
she
had
never
known
in
all
her
life
,
welled
up
inside
her
,
rose
like
bile
in
her
throat
.
It
came
to
her
aid
,
bringing
her
all
the
strength
she
needed
.
She
took
one
step
forward
and
picked
up
the
paperweight
from
the
vicar
's
desk
-
a
large
pebble
upon
which
Mrs
Longhill
had
painted
wild
flowers
as
a
birthday
present
for
her
husband
.
She
raised
her
arm
and
flung
it
hard
at
him
,
not
caring
where
it
hit
him
,
wanting
only
to
hurt
him
as
the
whole
world
had
hurt
her
;
wanting
to
see
his
cold
,
impassive
face
break
with
ordinary
human
emotion
.
He
had
no
time
to
move
.
Her
action
was
so
swift
that
he
was
hardly
aware
of
it
until
the
stone
struck
him
full
in
the
face
.
Blood
poured
from
his
nose
,
splashing
in
large
crimson
blots
on
the
sheaf
of
white
paper
in
front
of
him
.
But
Ruth
did
not
care
.
She
did
not
care
if
he
bled
to
death
in
front
of
her
.
She
was
too
angry
to
be
frightened
.
"
But
that
is
n't
all
I
have
to
say
!
"
she
screamed
.
"
You
are
a
devil
!
You
are
n't
a
man
,
you
're
a
devil
!
You
have
no
love
,
no
charity
,
no
compassion
in
you
.
I
hope
God
punishes
you
as
you
've
punished
me
!
"
In
the
middle
of
her
outbursts
,
she
noticed
that
the
paperweight
had
fallen
on
to
the
desk
,
badly
marking
the
surface
.
For
a
split
second
she
felt
sorry
about
that
.
Then
she
tore
from
the
room
.
She
was
dimly
aware
of
Mrs
Longhill
running
in
but
she
brushed
past
her
and
flew
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
.
Anger
gave
her
the
strength
to
pack
her
few
belongings
and
by
the
time
Ellen
-
red-eyed
and
in
tears
-
came
to
say
that
the
conveyance
was
at
the
door
,
there
was
no
sign
left
that
Ruth
had
ever
inhabited
the
room
.
For
the
last
few
minutes
before
Ellen
appeared
,
Ruth
stood
by
the
window
,
looking
down
the
dale
.
Her
passion
had
cooled
now
.
She
felt
weak
,
and
without
hope
.
But
not
repentant
,
not
one
bit
repentant
.
It
was
a
sunless
day
,
the
clouds
low
,
obscuring
the
tops
of
the
hills
and
threatening
rain
.
The
dale
had
weather
to
match
every
mood
,
Ruth
thought
.
In
the
two
years
or
more
that
she
had
been
in
Nordale
she
had
almost
come
to
think
of
it
as
home
.
Now
it
was
unlikely
that
she
would
ever
see
it
again
.
For
most
of
the
journey
to
Barnswick
Ruth
deliberately
tried
to
think
of
nothing
,
to
let
her
mind
go
blank
.
But
thoughts
pushed
their
way
in
.
What
should
she
do
?
Where
could
she
go
?
Would
Dick
,
even
if
she
wished
it
,
still
want
to
marry
her
?
And
what
about
Grandfather
?
Need
she
tell
Grandfather
the
truth
-
it
would
break
his
heart
.
Could
she
not
say
that
it
had
been
her
own
choice
to
leave
the
Longhills
,
that
they
were
not
suited
to
one
another
?
But
sooner
or
later
Mrs
Longhill
must
write
to
her
father
and
he
would
feel
obliged
to
speak
to
Ruth
's
family
.
Ruth
thought
he
might
be
kinder
than
his
son-in-law
,
but
it
was
not
something
he
would
take
lightly
.
Perhaps
Mrs
Longhill
had
already
written
during
the
days
Ruth
had
been
confined
to
bed
.
Since
the
railways
had
come
the
post
travelled
more
quickly
,
and
it
was
possible
that
her
grandfather
already
knew
everything
.
And
Hester
of
course
.
At
this
very
moment
they
might
be
expecting
her
arrival
.
When
Ruth
went
into
the
house
Hester
was
sitting
on
an
upright
chair
by
the
table
,
peeling
potatoes
.
Pansy
was
playing
on
the
rug
in
front
of
a
small
fire
and
Willie
sat
surrounded
by
his
toy
animals
.
The
baby
slept
peacefully
in
its
cradle
.
Ruth
saw
at
once
that
her
grandfather
was
not
in
the
room
,
but
she
took
it
for
granted
that
by
some
miracle
he
had
improved
enough
to
get
upstairs
and
was
resting
in
bed
.
It
was
a
stupid
thought
,
but
no
other
explanation
occurred
to
her
.
Hester
looked
startled
by
Ruth
's
appearance
,
and
jumped
to
her
feet
.
"
What
are
you
doing
here
?
What
do
you
want
?
"
she
demanded
.
Ruth
stared
at
her
.
It
was
reasonable
that
Hester
should
be
surprised
,
but
her
attitude
was
definitely
hostile
.
"
I
came
home
-
for
a
visit
,
"
she
temporised
.
"
Is
Grandfather
asleep
?
Can
I
waken
him
?
"
Hester
stared
at
her
without
speaking
.
"
What
is
it
?
"
Ruth
asked
quickly
.
"
There
's
something
wrong
,
is
n't
there
?
Is
he
ill
?
"
"
He
's
gone
,
"
Hester
said
.
"
Where
did
you
think
he
was
?
Hiding
under
the
table
?
"
"
Gone
!
"
Ruth
shrieked
the
word
at
her
.
The
baby
wakened
and
started
to
cry
.
"
Gone
!
Why
did
n't
you
let
me
know
he
was
ill
?
Why
did
n't
you
send
for
me
?
"
She
was
beside
herself
,
shouting
at
the
top
of
her
voice
for
the
second
time
that
day
.
Willie
screamed
.
"
I
said
he
's
gone
,
"
Hester
shouted
back
.
"
I
did
n't
say
he
was
dead
,
did
I
?
Stop
yelling
at
me
,
miss
!
"
Ruth
felt
dizzy
with
relief
.
She
was
still
weak
from
her
miscarriage
and
the
journey
had
been
trying
.
She
must
try
not
to
take
things
the
wrong
way
"
I
'm
sorry
.
You
startled
me
.
I
misunderstood
.
"
He
had
gone
to
Aunt
Sarah
's
,
of
course
.
They
had
fetched
him
for
Christmas
and
he
was
staying
on
for
the
New
Year
.
Ruth
heartily
wished
that
he
could
stay
there
for
good
.
"
You
mean
he
's
gone
to
Aunt
Sarah
's
?
"
she
said
more
calmly
.
"
I
wish
I
'd
known
.
I
'd
have
gone
straight
there
.
"
She
was
too
tired
now
to
walk
over
the
moor
but
she
would
set
off
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
She
knew
she
was
n't
welcome
in
Hester
's
house
but
Mrs
Johnson
would
give
her
a
bed
for
the
night
.
"
He
's
not
at
thy
Aunt
Sarah
's
neither
,
"
Hester
replied
.
Fear
gripped
Ruth
again
.
"
Then
where
is
he
?
What
are
you
keeping
from
me
?
"
"
He
's
gone
to
Dudley
House
,
"
Hester
said
reluctantly
.
Everything
that
the
day
had
contained
came
together
in
Ruth
's
head
.
She
thought
,
for
a
moment
,
that
she
must
go
mad
.
Then
she
skirted
the
table
,
gripped
her
stepmother
by
the
shoulders
,
and
began
to
shake
her
as
if
she
was
no
more
than
a
rag
doll
.
"
Dudley
House
!
"
she
shrieked
.
"
You
sent
my
grandfather

House

How
dare
you
do
such
a
thing

"
Dudley
House
was
the
workhouse
.
It
was
reputedly
neither
fit
for
man
nor
beast
;
"
reputedly
"
because
few
people
who
went
in
there
ever
came
out
to
tell
the
tale
.
The
dread
of
one
day
being
an
inmate
darkened
the
life
of
every
poor
person
for
miles
around
.
She
continued
to
shake
her
stepmother
,
screaming
in
her
rage
.
Shock
alone
,
since
the
older
woman
was
physically
far
more
powerful
,
rendered
Hester
helpless
in
the
girl
's
grip
.
She
could
do
nothing
except
cry
out
.
"

Willie
cried
.
"

It
was
Willie
's
words
which
brought
Ruth
to
her
senses
.
She
let
go
of
Hester
and
Willie
ran
to
his
stepmother
,
flinging
his
arms
around
her

Once
out
of
Ruth

grasp

Hester
recovered
quickly
.
"

On
the
very
next
day
she
would
get
her

certain

What
they

do

how
they
would

it
back

in
some
cheap
lodging-house

could
decide
what
was
to

I
saw
him
go

"
she
said
.
"
It
were
a
cold
day

looked
perished
.
But
you
must
n't
be
too
hard
on
Hester
.
She
's
had
a
bad
time
and
no
mistake
.
"
But
Ruth
was
in
no
mood
to
make
allowances
for
Hester
.
It
was
surprising
,
she
thought
,
that
Mrs
Johnson
did
n't
ask
her
what
she
was
doing
in
Barnswick
.
Ruth
had
decided
to
say
she
'd
been
unwell
,
and
had
been
given
a
few
days
off
to
recover
her
strength
.
Indeed
,
except
that
she
was
deadly
tired
,
she
had
herself
almost
forgotten
the
reason
for
her
homecoming
in
the
more
important
matter
of
her
grandfather
's
plight
.
Ruth
left
Barnswick
next
morning
.
Dudley
House
was
just
outside
the
village
of
the
same
name
and
the
easiest
way
to
get
there
was
to
walk
.
She
was
feeling
better
after
a
night
's
rest
-
surprisingly
,
she
had
slept
well
.
"
Make
a
good
breakfast
,
"
Mrs
Johnson
advised
.
"
And
I
've
packed
you
a
currant
teacake
for
a
"
biting
on
"
,
though
you
should
be
at
Dudley
afore
dinnertime
.
"
Ruth
planned
to
find
somewhere
in
Dudley
where
she
and
her
grandfather
might
stay
for
the
night
.
With
a
place
to
take
him
to
,
she
thought
,
the
Workhouse
Master
would
be
more
likely
to
let
her
grandfather
go
with
her
.
If
the
workhouse
was
as
overcrowded
as
everyone
said
,
then
surely
they
'd
be
only
too
pleased
to
get
one
inmate
off
their
hands
?
In
the
village
she
stopped
at
the
blacksmith
's
.
"
I
'm
looking
for
lodgings
for
me
and
my
grandfather
,
"
she
said
.
"
Somewhere
homely
,
and
not
too
expensive
.
"
The
blacksmith
straightened
up
and
looked
at
her
.
He
saw
a
tall
thin
girl
,
with
dark
hair
escaping
from
under
her
bonnet
.
Large
amber-brown
eyes
,
filled
with
anxiety
,
met
his
.
She
was
about
the
same
age
as
his
own
daughter
but
she
looked
as
if
she
had
the
troubles
of
the
world
on
her
.
"
I
reckon
Mrs
Taylor
will
look
after
thee
,
"
he
told
Ruth
.
"
She
sometimes
takes
lodgers
.
"
Ruth
took
to
Mrs
Taylor
the
moment
that
lady
opened
the
door
.
She
had
the
same
kindly
look
as
Aunt
Sarah
.
Moreover
,
she
had
a
room
to
let
on
the
ground
floor
,
with
two
beds
.
"
A
shilling
a
night
,
to
include
supper
and
breakfast
,
"
the
landlady
said
.
Ruth
paid
in
advance
for
the
first
night
.
She
thought
it
a
mite
expensive
,
but
it
looked
a
respectable
place
,
and
Mrs
Taylor
had
been
sympathetic
about
Grandfather
.
"
I
could
tell
you
a
few
tales
about
yon
place
,
"
she
remarked
,
jerking
her
head
in
the
direction
of
Dudley
House
.
"
Tales
as
would
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
!
"
Ruth
hoped
she
would
n't
,
at
least
until
she
had
Grandfather
safely
out
of
it
.
"
I
've
some
stew
and
dumplings
only
needs
warming
up
,
"
Mrs
Taylor
said
.
"
You
look
as
if
a
good
meal
would
n't
come
amiss
.
"
When
she
had
eaten
,
Ruth
set
off
for
Dudley
House
.
It
was
about
a
mile
from
the
village
,
set
back
from
the
road
,
with
tall
iron
gates
,
securely
locked
,
at
the
entrance
,
and
a
few
yards
inside
them
a
lodge
.
The
big
house
was
visible
at
the
top
of
the
drive
.
It
was
several
storeys
high
,
with
many
small
windows
,
some
of
which
were
barred
.
Ruth
rang
the
bell
at
the
gate
and
a
man
came
out
of
the
lodge
to
attend
to
her
.
"
My
grandfather
's
in
here
,
"
she
said
.
"
I
want
to
speak
to
the
Master
about
him
.
"
"
Oh
you
do

you

"
he
replied
,
not
unkindly
.
"
Then
you
'd
best
come
in
.
I
do
n't
know

'll
see
thee
.
He
's
a
very
busy
man
.
First
off
,
what
's
your
grandfather
's
name
?
"
"
Enoch
Appleby
.
He
came
here
five
days
ago
,
just
after
Christmas
.
I
've
come
to
get
him
out
.
"
From
the
look
he
gave
her
she
thought
that
must
n't
happen
often
.
"
I
've
got
lodgings

she
went
on
.
"
He

So
could
I
please
see
the
Master
and
arrange
it
as
quickly
as
possible
?
"
The
man
continued
to
look
at
her
strangely
,
and
then
at
last
he
said
,
"
It
'll
not
do
you
any
good
,
love
.
"
"
You
ca
n't

"
Ruth
replied
.
"
If
I
could
just
see
the
Master
I
could
explain
to
him
.
It
was
a
mistake
,
sending
my
grandfather
here
!
"
"
What
I
mean
,
love
,
"
the
man
said
slowly
,
"
is
that

wo
n't
do

good

,

died
the
day
afore

"
She
stared
at
him
.
It
could
n't
possibly
be
true
.
Not
her
grandfather
;
not
when
she
had
come
to
fetch
him
;
not
at
last
when
he
was
going
to
live
with
her
and
everything
was
going
to
be
all
right
.
Why
was
this
man
lying
to
her
?
"
You
must
have
made
a
mistake
.
Perhaps
you
've
got
the
name
wrong

"
Her
voice
was
sharp
,
pleading
with
him
.
He
had
to
be
wrong
,
otherwise
she
could
n't
bear
it
.
The
man
consulted
a
list
pinned
to
the
wall
,
then
turned
back
to
her
,
shaking
his
head
.
"
I
'm
sorry
,
miss
.
There
's
no
mistake

A
letter
was
sent
to
his
next-of-kin
,
Mrs
Sarah
Gaunt

I
thought
you
'd
likely
come
from
her

collect
his
bits

pieces

Not
that
there
's
much

So

was
true

How
could

knew

She
thought
she
was
crying
the
words
aloud
,
but
all
that
came
back
to
her
was
her
voice
-
flat
,
low
,
saying
,

handed
her
a
small
bundle

It
contained
a
bible

a
penknife
with
a
horn
handle
,
a
clay
pipe
,
and
the
verse
which
she
had
written
out
for
him
two
Christmases
ago

worldly
possessions

freshly-turned

around

nothing

animal

hardly

the

fourteen

unsteadily
behind
her

Ruth
stretched
out
her
hands
to
the
red
glow

wondering
if
she
would
ever
again
be
warm
all
through

was
no

She
made
no

break
it
gently

her
mood
was
not
tactful
.

Ernest
stared
at
her
in
astonishment
,
Charlotte
standing
silently
behind
him
.
"

Ruth
accused
him
,
her
voice
sharp
and
cutting
.
Ernest
's
face
flamed
.
He
stepped
forward
and
took
hold
of
Ruth
's
wrists
,
as
if
he
would
forcibly
stop
her
.
"
Now

Hold

Ruth
said
bitterly

Ruth
went
upstairs
.
Frost
,
like
thickly
appliqued
lace
medallions
,
patterned
the
bedroom
window
,
and
water
in
a
cup
by
the
bedside
had
formed
a
solid
block
of
ice
.
She
was
thankful
that
she
still
wore
her
cloak
.
Propped
up
in
bed
to
ease
her
breathing
,
her
nightcap
pulled
down
over
her
ears
,
Aunt
Sarah
seemed
to
have
shrunk
inside
the
shawls
which
had
been
heaped
upon
her
against
the
chill
of
the
room
.
Ruth
supposed
that
there
was
n't
enough
coal
for
her
to
have
a
fire
in
the
grate
,
but
this
was
no
way
to
cure
a
bad
chest
.
Ruth
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
room
for
a
few
seconds
,
looking
at
her
aunt
who
was
drifting
on
the
edge
of
sleep
.
Presently
,
Sarah
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
her
visitor
.
A
wide
smile
of
welcome
broke
over
her
face
as
she
brought
her
niece
into
focus
.
Seeing
Aunt
Sarah
so
unusually
ill
and
helpless
,
Ruth
was
filled
with
grief
for
her
sake
at
the
news
she
had
brought
.
"
Why

Ruth

I
thought
I
were
dreaming

Whatever
are
you
doing
here

But
whatever
it
is
,
it
's
welcome
.
You
'll
do
me
more
good
nor
a
bucket
o'
medicine
.
Come
here
and
give
us
a
kiss

"
Ruth
kissed
her
aunt
and
then
,
clasping
her
hands
tightly
in
her
own
,
she
said
what
she
had
to
say
as
gently
as
possible
.
"
Nay
lass
!
"
Sarah
said
.
"
Nay
lass
,
it
's
a
bad

"
She
searched
around
for
further
words
to
express
her
grief
,
but
could
find
none
,
and
kept
repeating
herself
.
"
Nay
,
but
it
's
a
bad
do

"
Tears
ran
down
both
their
faces
,
and
though
neither
could
shoulder
the
other
's
pain
,
they
were
glad
of
each
other
's
company
in
their
sorrow
.
"
You
know
I
'd
never
have
let
it

Aunt
Sarah
said
presently
.
"
Not

a
thousand
years

He
were
a
good

had
time
for

we
were

would
n't
have

.
"
"
I
know
,
"
Ruth
assured
her
.
But
it
had
happened
.
She
wondered
again
what
her
grandfather
's
thoughts
and
feelings
had
been
in
those
few
days
at
Dudley
House
.
Was
it
because
he
had
no
hope
that
he
had
lasted
so
short
a
time
?
Or
was
it
just
possible
that
right
to
the
end
he
had
believed
that
she
would
find
out
,
and
come
to
him
?
She
prayed
that
it
was
so
,
but
she
would
never
know
.
She
was
aware
what
her
aunt
's
next
question
must
be
.
"
And
I
suppose
you
've
come
home
for
a
day
or
two
's
holiday
?
Well
,
that
was
Providence
all
right
!
When
must
you
go
back
?
"
So
Ruth
told
her
the
truth
,
but
not
quite
the
whole
truth
since
she
kept
Dick
's
name
out
of
it
.
That
was
wiser
than
she
knew
since
it
deflected
her
aunt
from
the
shock
of
the
announcement
and
gave
her
something
to
pursue
.
"
But
Ruth
,

man

Surely

there
on

Moss
,

not

Sarah
stopped
in
the
act
of
fastening
her
stays
around
her
vast
body
.
In
the
ice-cold
room
the
sweat
of
weakness
beaded
her
forehead
and
her
upper
lip

"
Her
words
went
in
like
a
knife
.
Ruth
could
find
no
answer
.
When
her
aunt
was
dressed
she
walked
slowly
down
the
narrow
staircase
in
front
of
her
in
case
,
in
her
weak
state
,
she
should
stumble
.
From
New
Year
's
Day
onwards
,
the
whole
of
1849
,
the
last
year
she
expected
to
spend
in
England
,
was
to
Ruth
simply
a
period
of
temporising
;
of
waiting
,
though
seldom
patiently
,
for
the
only
event
which
had
come
to
mean
anything
.
It
was
not
a
time
of
inaction
,
for
there
was
plenty
to
be
done
.
If
Ernest
was
keen
,
Ruth
was
ten
times
keener
.
While
he
and
Charlotte
went
steadily
ahead
making
their
preparations
,
Ruth
rushed
at
hers
as
if
the
summons
to
depart
might
arrive
the
very
next
day
.
In
theory
that
was
possible
.
She
had
quickly
joined
the
emigration
society
of
which
her
cousins
were
already
members
,
and
it
had
been
agreed
that
she
should
count
as
part
of
their
family
.
Each
month
lots
were
drawn
for
the
names
of
the
next
families
to
leave
,
and
the
fortunate
ones
were
given
only
a
short
time
to
make
their
final
preparations
.
Charlotte
was
busy
with
preparations
of
another
kind
.
She
had
confided
to
Ruth
that
she
was
pregnant
again
.
"
Only
do
n't
tell
Ma
,
"
she
begged
.
"
She
'll
be
that
angry
wi'
me
.
Anyway
,
she
'll
know
soon
enough
.
"
Poor
Charlotte
,
Ruth
thought
,
to
be
married
,
yet
not
able
to
take
pleasure
in
her
pregnancy
-
though
she
perhaps
misjudged
her
mother-in-law
a
little
.
"
When
is
it
due
?
"
Ruth
asked
.
"
The
middle
of
June
.
"
Ruth
caught
her
breath
.
It
was
when
she
would
have
had
her
child
.
When
he
knew
of
his
wife
's
pregnancy
Ernest
requested
that
none
of
their
names
should
go
into
the
ballot
until
after
the
baby
's
birth

"

he
said
.
"
Let
alone
on
that
trek
across
America
!
"
Although
they
would
land
in
New
York
,
they
were
to
go
immediately
from
there
to
Wisconsin
where
the
English
,
including
several
families
from
the
West
Riding
of
Yorkshire
,
had
begun
to
settle
.
"
Happen
you
'll
change
your
minds

"
Aunt
Sarah
remarked
when
she
heard
.
"
Who
in
their
right
senses
would
want
to
take
a
babby
in
arms
on
a
journey
like
that
?
"
"
It
's
no

Ernest
said
gently
.
"
My
mind
's
made
up
and
you
'll
not

it

I
've
begged

Father
to
come
with
us
.
There
's
older
folk
than
you
have
taken
the
step
and
I
reckon
it
'd
be
a
better
life
for
both
of
you

"
Once
,
when
they
were
alone
together
,
Ruth
asked
her
aunt
,
"
Why
wo
n't
you
come
?
What
's
the
reason
?
"
"
It
's
not
that
I
'm
afraid
of
living
in
a
strange
place

Ruth
.
I
could
do
that

aye
and
work
hard
an'
all
.
But
-
"
She
faltered
.
"
But
I
'm
afraid
of
dying
there
-
and
that
's
the
truth
.
When
you
get
older
(
she
was
not
yet
fifty
)
you
begin
to
think
about
death
.
It
's
frightening
.
But
to
be
where
you
've
always
been
makes
it
easier
.
And
I
've
lived
hereabouts
since
I
were
born
.
I
would
n't
want
to
die
in
a
strange
land

"
"
But

have
your
family

"
Ruth
pointed
out
.
"
When
the
time
comes
that
will
make
up
for
everything
.
"
"
My
roots
are
here
,
"
Sarah
said
quietly
.
"
They
go
deep
.

wither

I
'm
like
that

Ruth
.
"
She
and
Uncle
Matthew
had
agreed
,
in
spite
of
her
strong
disapproval
of
Ruth
's
plans
for
the
future
,
that
she
should
live
with
them
until
the
time
came
to
leave
.
Ruth
slept
on
a
sofa
downstairs
.
She
did
n't
mind
.
In
any
case
,
nothing
was
for
long
.
She
was
grateful
not
only
to
be
with
her
aunt
and
uncle
in
that
last
year
,
but
to
be
near
Ernest
and
Charlotte
so
that
they
could
discuss
,
usually
when
the
older
couple
had
gone
to
bed
,
the
life
which
lay
so
tantalisingly
before
them
.
Ernest
regularly
had
advice
from
the
emigrants'society
and
this
he
would
read
out
aloud
.
"
Take
a
good
supply
of
flour
and
biscuits
.
Take
a
good
book
or
two
.
Keep
yourself
clean
from
head
to
foot
and
provide
yourself
with
opening
medicine
in
case
of
need
.
Be
ready
to
work
hard
in
your
new
country

"
He
broke
off
.
"
I
'm
ready
to
do
that
,
"
he
said
.
"
I
'll
work
all
hours
God
sends

"
"
So
will
we
all
,
"
Ruth
agreed
.
"
Go
on
reading
.
"
He
found
the
place
again
,
following
the
text
with
his
forefinger
.
"
Prepare
for
difficult
times

ask
for
God

blessing

"
"
There
's
a
long
list
of
equipment
here
,
"
Ruth
pointed
out
.
"
Look
!
A
strong
iron
pan
for
cooking
our
food
on
board
.
No
end
of
clothing
.
-
"
"
It
'll
take
us
all
our
time
to
afford
that
lot
,
"
Ernest
said
doubtfully
.
"
But
it
just
goes
to
show
,
"
Ruth
said
,
"
that
they
were
right
when
they
said
emigrants
should
n't
wait
to
leave
until
they
were
too
far
gone
in
poverty
,
but
should
go
while
they
still
have
enough
to
provision
themselves
.
"
"
It
's
sound
enough
advice
for
those
that
can
afford
to
follow
it
,
"
Charlotte
remarked
.
Ruth
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
job
in
Ilkley
.
The
landlord
of
the
inn
which
Ernest
visited
when
his
mother
and
his
wife
became
too
much
for
him
knew
of
a
coffee-house
in
the
town
which
needed
a
kitchenmaid
,
and
because
he
put
in
a
good
word
for
her
,
Ruth
was
given
the
job
without
references
.
She
was
paid
four
shillings
a
week
and
given
her
midday
meal
.
She
thought
it
was
good
pay
,
but
well
earned
.
Every
week
she
was
able
to
give
Aunt
Sarah
something
for
her
keep
and
she
had
a
little
left
over
to
save
.
She
managed
to
persuade
Ernest
to
take
a
proportion
of
this
to
augment
his
savings
.
It
was
hard
for
him
to
scrape
together
more
than
a
few
coppers
at
a
time
.
"
I
do
n't
like
taking
your
money
,
Ruth
,
"
he
protested
.
"
It
's
not
right
.
"
"
But
it
is
,
"
Ruth
argued
.
"
You
must
know
that
the
companionship
of
you
and
Charlotte
in
a
strange
land
will
be
beyond
price
to
me
.
"
She
should
have
realised
,
there
and
then
,
by
the
glance
Charlotte
gave
her
husband
and
the
way
in
which
he
refused
to
meet
it
,
that
her
plan
to
accompany
them
was
a
bone
of
contention
.
But
she
pretended
to
herself
that
she
had
not
seen
it
,
or
that
she
had
misinterpreted
it
.
She
hated
her
work
in
the
coffee-house
,
standing
all
day
long
at
the
sink
in
the
ill-ventilated
pantry
.
She
was
glad
when
her
work
was
done
and
she
could
walk
back
to
the
farm
,
filling
her
lungs
with
the
keen
moorland
air
.
She
cherished
those
walks
.
Every
tuft
of
grass
,
flower
,
bird
,
was
precious
to
her
and
she
wanted
to
store
them
in
her
memory
,
against
the
day
when
they
would
no
longer
be
hers
.
As
the
long
,
cold
winter
merged
into
spring
she
wondered
if
America
,
or
any
place
on
earth
,
could
be
as
beautiful
as
her
native
moors
.
She
wrote
to
Dick
,
not
mentioning
her
miscarriage
,
telling
him
of
her
plans
.
"
I
know
I
could
have
made
you
happy
,
Ruth
,
"
he
replied
.
"
And
if
ever
you
want
me
,
you
know
where
I
am
.
"
She
wished
with
all
her
heart
she
could
have
found
contentment
with
him
.
Throughout
that
spring
they
saw
nothing
of
Maria
,
and
only
the
occasional
letter
came
.
She
clearly
had
no
time
for
Burley
Woodhead
when
there
was
so
much
going
on
in
Bradford
.
"
She
's
gotten
too
grand
for
us
,
"
Aunt
Sarah
said
.
"
I
do
n't
think
so
,
"
Ruth
replied
doubtfully
.
"
But
you
know
how
she
always
likes
to
be
in
the
centre
of
things
.
"
Then
at
the
beginning
of
summer
Maria
wrote
to
say
that
she
was
coming
to
spend
a
few
days
with
them
.
But
a
day
or
two
before
she
was
due
,
Ernest
returned
from
Ilkley
with
unwelcome
news
.
"
There
's
cholera
in
Leeds
and
in
Bradford
,
"
he
said
.
"
It
looks
as
if
it
's
bad
,
an'
all
.
"
"
Ruth
,
you
must
write
at
once
to
Maria
,
"
Aunt
Sarah
urged
.
"
Tell
her
she
must
n't
come
yet
.
We
have
to
think
of
little
Enoch
.
"
"
And
of
Charlotte
,
"
Ernest
pointed
out
.
"
She
's
not
strong
at
the
moment
.
She
's
fit
to
catch
whatever
's
going
.
"
So
Ruth
wrote
at
once
,
asking
Maria
to
postpone
her
visit
and
bidding
her
take
care
of
herself
.
She
gave
her
letter
to
the
postman
with
a
heavy
heart
,
wondering
if
she
would
ever
see
her
sister
again
.
Charlotte
's
daughter
was
born
on
the
first
of
June
,
a
week
or
two
earlier
than
expected
.
"
She
's
to
be
named
"
Jane
"
after
Charlotte
's
mother
,
"
Ernest
said
.
"
I
could
wish
she
was
stronger
,
and
Charlotte
happier
.
"
Aunt
Sarah
shook
her
head
.
"
I
'd
be
glad
to
hear
the
little
mite
cry
more
.
It
's
not
natural
for
a
babby
to
be
so
quiet
.
"
Eventually
,
both
mother
and
baby
gained
strength
,
and
Ruth
saw
relief
replace
worry
in
Ernest
's
face
as
his
daughter
began
to
thrive
,
and
his
wife
to
smile
at
him
.
On
a
day
in
autumn
Ruth
told
her
aunt
,
"
They
say
the
cholera
's
on
the
wane
now

It
would
be
safe
for
Maria
to
come

do
so
long
to
see
her

Aunt
Sarah

Aunt
Sarah
said
.
Maria
replied
that
she
was
to
be
allowed
to
come
for
two
days
in
the
week
following
her
letter
.
"
I
shall
ask

Ruth
said
.
"

She
was
on
her
way
to
Ilkley
,
to
meet
Maria
,
when
she
saw
the
postman
climbing
the
hill
.
"
There
's
a
letter
for
your
Ernest
,
"
he
told
her
.
"
I
reckon
it
's
from
them
emigration
people
.
"
He
usually
guessed
at
the
contents
of
letters
,
and
stood
around
waiting
for
his
guesses
to
be
confirmed
.
Ruth
's
heart
began
to
thump
so
loudly
that
she
thought
he
must
hear
it
.
"
I
'll
turn
back
and
take
it
myself
,
"
she
said
,
trying
to
sound
calm
.
They
were
all
in
the
kitchen
where
she
had
left
them
a
few
minutes
earlier
.
Aunt
Sarah
was
at
the
table
,
kneading
the
bread
dough
;
Ernest
and
Uncle
Matthew
,
back
from
the
top
field
,
were
taking
a
late
breakfast
.
Charlotte
sat
feeding
her
baby
while
Enoch
played
on
the
hearthrug
.
Ruth
handed
the
letter
to
Ernest
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
they
must
all
know
what
it
contained
.
Ernest
opened
it
in
silence
,
his
hands
trembling
.
Aunt
Sarah
stopped
kneading
.
Uncle
Matthew
cupped
his
hand
around
the
mug
of
tea
he
was
holding
.
For
a
single
moment
,
Charlotte
stopped
suckling
the
child
.
The
only
sound
in
the
kitchen
,
while
they
watched
Ernest
reading
the
letter
,
was
from
Enoch
,
happily
singing
a
nursery
rhyme
.
"
We
've
drawn
lucky
!
"
Ernest
said
quietly
.
"
We
sail
out
of
Liverpool
next
March
the
eighth
on
the
Flamingo

York
.
"
Sarah
's
hands
,
imprisoned
in
the
bread
dough
,
could
not
wipe
away
the
tears
which
ran
down
her
face
.
They
dropped
in
the
earthenware
bowl
,
and
were
absorbed
,
so
that
when
,
later
,
Ruth
helped
to
eat
that
morning
's
baking
,
she
imagined
she
could
taste
the
bitterness
of
the
tears
.
Her
uncle
gazed
at
the
tea
in
his
mug
as
if
the
hot
liquid
might
be
the
Atlantic
Ocean
itself
.
Charlotte
said
nothing
,
but
her
face
lit
up
with
pleasure
and
she
bent
her
head
over
the
baby
so
as
not
to
show
it
.
"
March
the
eighth

Ruth
said
,
breaking
the
long
silence
.
"
My
eighteenth
birthday
.
Perhaps
that
's
a
good
omen
?
"
It
was
a
cruel
,
tactless
thing
to
say
and
she
could
have
bitten
out
her
tongue
the
second
the
words
were
spoken
,
but
the
excitement
bubbling
inside
her
was
too
much
to
contain
.
"
I
'm
sorry
,
Aunt
Sarah
!
"
she
cried
.
But
Ernest
was
by
his
mother
's
side
,
his
arm
around
her
shoulders
.
Without
speaking
,
she
elbowed
him
out
of
the
way
and
continued
with
her
baking
,
thumping
and
banging
the
dough
into
shape
,
all
the
time
her
tears
falling
silently
.
Ruth
went
out
of
the
house
and
ran
down
the
steep
moorland
path
all
the
way
to
Ilkley
.
She
must
not
be
late
for
Maria
.
The
next
day
Ruth
persuaded
Maria
,
not
without
difficulty
,
to
walk
over
to
Barnswick
with
her
.
"
I
do
n't
see

we
should

Maria
protested
.
"

"
"

Ruth

"
She
had
to
make
sure
that
Willie
was
happy
,
and
thriving
.
Having
been
all
this
time
contented
about
his
welfare
,
now
that
her
leaving
was
fixed
and
certain
,
she
had
begun
to
have
misgivings
.
Supposing
Hester
should
turn
against
him
?
"
Of
course
she
wo

Maria
said

goes

"
I
promise

Ruth
insisted
.
"
I

"
"
And

"
"
Yes
.
Oh

it
,
Ruth
!
"
So
they
walked
across
the
moor
.
The
heather
had
faded
from
its
summer
brilliance
,
emerging
a
deeper
,
softer
purple
from
the
counterpane
of
autumn
mist
which
covered
the
ground
.
Although
Ruth
now
knew
that
she
would
be
on
the
moor
throughout
the
coming
winter
,
and
perhaps
if
she
was
lucky
see
the
first
,
early
signs
of
spring
,
she
knew
she
was
now
taking
her
farewell
of
its
chief
beauty
.
She
would
not
see
the
heather
again
.
Much
as
she
had
wanted
her
sister
's
company
,
she
almost
wished
Maria
was
not
there
.
She
wanted
to
fling
herself
to
the
ground
,
to
lie
there
with
her
body
pressed
against
the
purple
glory
.
For
the
rest
of
the
journey
Maria
prattled
on
about
Bradford
,
but
Ruth
did
not
hear
a
word
.
When
Ruth
saw
Willie
she
realised
that
she
need
not
have
worried
about
him
.
He
had
grown
another
inch
or
two
but
he
was
still
plump
and
rosy
,
with
a
solid
contented
look
about
him
.
He
greeted
his
sisters
with
a
mild
show
of
affection
but
it
was
obvious
that
his
home
was
here
with
Hester
,
and
that
he
was
happy
in
it
.
Hester
,
except
that
she
was
a
little
thinner
,
seemed
no
different
.
Ruth
doubted
that
anything
would
dim
her
stepmother
's
exuberance
for
long
.
No
reference
at
all
was
made
to
Enoch
Appleby
,
though
Ernest
had
written
to
Hester
with
the
news
.
But
Hester
made
them
reasonably
welcome
.
"
I
daresay
you
'd
like
something
to
eat
,
"
she
said
.
"
I
'm
ravenous
!
"
Maria
admitted
.
"
And
you
,
Ruth
?
"
"
I
'm
not
hungry
,
"
Ruth
replied
quickly
.
"
Thank
you
all
the
same
.
"
Hester
shrugged
.
"
Suit
yourself
.
Then
I
'll
boil
you
a
fresh
egg
,
Maria
.
"
She
knows
,
Ruth
thought
,
that
I
could
never
take
another
bite
from
her
.
But
she
had
not
come
to
quarrel
with
Hester
,
she
had
come
to
see
Willie
.
She
must
get
it
over
with
quickly
,
and
leave
.
Every
minute
she
was
in
the
house
where
she
had
spent
most
of
her
life
,
crowded
as
it
was
with
memories
of
her
parents
and
her
grandfather
,
made
it
more
difficult
to
bear
up
.
If
she
was
not
to
break
down
completely
,
and
in
front
of
Hester
,
she
must
say
goodbye
to
Willie
,
and
go
.
She
bent
down
and
took
him
in
her
arms
.
He
pulled
away
,
startled
by
the
vehemence
of
her
embrace
.
"
It
will
be
a
long
time
before
I
see
you
again
,
Willie
,
"
she
said
.
"
Be
a
good
boy
,
wo
n't
you
?
Always
say
your
prayers
,
and
ask
God
to
bless
your
Ruth
.
"
Then
she
ran
out
of
the
house
,
bumping
into
Tom
Firth
,
the
landlord
of
the
Shoulder
of
Mutton
,
as
he
came
in
.
"
Why
,
it
's
Ruth
!
"
he
exclaimed
.
She
ran
past
him
without
speaking
.
He
turned
and
watched
her
,
puzzled
.
He
had
known
Ruth
since
she
was
born
.
Her
father
had
been
his
best
friend
.
Why
would
she
do
that
?
He
shrugged
,
and
went
in
to
see
Hester
.
Ruth
had
called
to
see
Mrs
Johnson
,
looked
in
on
one
or
two
of
the
other
neighbours
,
and
was
halfway
up
the
hill
to
the
churchyard
before
Maria
caught
up
with
her
.
"
We
had
a
lovely
tea
,
"
Maria
said
.
"
I
had
two
eggs
and
some
seed
cake

Why
did
n't
you
stay

"
"
What
a
question
!
"
Ruth
exclaimed
.
"
You

would
n't

"

Hester
was
pleased

me

meal

But
then
you
were
never
fair

you

Right
from

"

Ruth
accused

"

said
angrily
.
"

answered
.
"

"
Ruth
closed
her
lips
firmly
.
She
would
simply
not
say
another
word
on
the
subject
.
She
did
n't
want
to
quarrel
with
Maria
,
today
of
all
days
,
when
they
had
so
little
time
left
together
.
She
went
into
the
churchyard
and
found
their
parents
'
grave
.
There
was
no
headstone
,
but
it
was
neatly
tended
and
there
were
fresh
flowers
in
a
stone
jar
.
Had
Hester
placed
them
there
?
Was
it
true
,
what
Maria
said
,
that
she
had
never
been
fair
to
Hester
?
She
pushed
the
thought
away
.
For
a
few
minutes
she
knelt
by
the
grave
,
and
was
presently
joined
by
Maria
.
Then
without
speaking
she
stood
up
and
walked
away
,
down
the
hill
,
back
towards
the
moor
.
Maria
caught
up
with
her
as
they
reached
the
end
of
the
village
.
"

Maria
asked

Ruth
cried
thrusting
her
arm
through

sister

as
they
walked
.
Christmas
came
and
went
and
Ruth
was
glad
to
see
the
back
of
it
.
There
was
neither
joy
nor
peace
in

house

found
herself
wishing

time
away
until
it

She
could
not
bear
her
aunt
's
desperate
face
,
nor
her
uncle
's
increasing
silence
.
By
the
beginning
of
February
they
had
collected
together
most
of
their
provisions
.
Tea
,
oatmeal
,
sugar
;
a
precious
jar
of
goose
fat
for
rubbing
into
the
children
's
chests
should
they
take
bronchitis
on
the
journey
.
They
took
senna
pods
and
a
small
bottle
of
brandy
against
bowels
under-
or
overactive
;
a
bottle
of
Dr
Barton
's
cough
mixture
and
,
of
course
,
their
bibles
and
prayer
books
.
From
her
savings
Ruth
had
bought
new
boots
,
stockings
,
a
warm
flannel
petticoat
and
a
gown
made
of
Yorkshire
wool
.

Ruth
asked
,
not
for
the
first
time
.
It
was
their
constant
anxiety
.
"

the
worst

have

Ernest
admitted
.

As
late
as
the
end
of
February
it
looked
as
though
this
was
what
they
would
have
to
do
,
and
then
one
evening
Ernest
returned
from
a
visit
to
Ilkley
flushed
with
excitement
.
When
he
entered
the
kitchen
,
bringing
a
great
gust
of
cold
air
with
him
,
he
was
all
smiles
.
He
pulled
Charlotte
into
his
arms
in
an
embrace
so
fierce
that
she
drew
back
,
staring
at
him
.
"
Nay

he
assured
her

Aunt
Sarah
did
not
so
much
as
lift
her
head
from
the
rug
she
was
making
,

Ruth
watched
the
way
the
rug
hook
stabbed
the
canvas
with
increased
speed
and
vigour
,
as
if
she
wanted

it

Aunt
Sarah
was
right
in
saying
that
it
would
take
five
days
to
reach
Liverpool
,
since
the
barge
could
go
no
faster
than
the
horse
which
pulled
it
.
Then
,
fearful
of
things
going
wrong
-
their
greatest
dread
was
that
they
would
be
late
and
that
the
ship
would
sail
without
them
-
they
decided
to
allow
an
extra
twenty-four
hours
.
On
that
last
night
they
finished
packing
their
bundles
,
tied
them
securely
and
left
them
in
the
kitchen
ready
for
the
morning
.
After
that
there
was
a
good
meal
of
mutton
stew
and
Aunt
Sarah
's
feather-light
dumplings
(
none
of
which
anyone
could
eat
)
and
they
went
to
bed
early
.
For
Ruth
it
was
impossible
to
sit
there
in
the
kitchen
,
seeing
Aunt
Sarah
's
stricken
face
,
in
a
silence
which
was
more
deafening
than
words
.
Ruth
thought
her
aunt
would
have
sat
up
all
night
to
prolong
the
time
with
them
,
but
her
uncle
-
who
had
tried
bravely
all
day
to
behave
as
though
nothing
untoward
was
happening
-
put
his
arms
around
his
wife
's
shoulders
and
led
her
away
to
bed
.
She
went
as
if
to
her
execution
.
Ruth
did
not
sleep
much
,
and
when
Ernest
came
downstairs
next
morning
she
was
already
up
and
doing
.
"
Half-past
five
,
"
he
said
softly
.
Ruth
opened
the
door
and
went
outside
.
There
were
stars
in
the
clear
,
dark
sky
,
and
a
white
frost
over
the
moor
.
It
would
have
been
easier
to
set
off
in
the
daylight
but
it
was
n't
possible
.
They
had
a
long
walk
over
the
moor
to
Bingley
and
Alfred
Carter
could
n't
afford
to
wait
for
them
if
they
were
late
.
When
she
went
back
into
the
house
her
aunt
was
busy
with
the
last
meal
she
would
prepare
for
her
family
.
They
forced
themselves
to
eat
the
porridge
,
the
eggs
fresh
from
the
nest
,
for
they
had
a
long
day
before
them
.
The
last
hour
on
the
farm
was
an
eternity
.
It
seemed
to
Ruth
,
what
her
aunt
had
long
suspected
,
that
to
part
with
loved
ones
while
they
are
still
living
,
with
never
a
hope
of
seeing
them
again
,
was
worse
than
losing
them
by
death
.
For
a
moment
,
just
before
they
left
the
house
,
as
she
and
her
aunt
clung
tightly
to
each
other
,
the
silent
tears
coursing
down
their
faces
,
Ruth
hated
America
and
wished
that
it
had
never
been
discovered
.
But
once
they
had
left
the
house
,
and
were
at
last
too
far
away
to
hear
her
aunt
's
and
uncle
's
farewells
,
or
to
see
them
as
they
stood
outside
in
the
yard
,
silhouetted
against
the
lighted
kitchen
,
excitement
began
to
creep
into
Ruth
and
her
spirits
began
to
lift
.
They
met
up
with
Alfred
Carter
sooner
than
expected
.
He
was
waiting
for
them
with
his
barge
by
the
first
footbridge
over
the
canal
as
they
came
down
from
the
moor
.
It
was
almost
daylight
now
,
still
cold
and
frosty
.
The
horse
blew
great
jets
of
steam
from
its
nostrils
as
it
stood
on
the
towpath
,
patiently
waiting
for
them
to
board
.
There
was
a
minute
cabin
on
the
barge
,
no
more
than
a
place
for
the
bargee
to
take
shelter
.
"
For
you
ladies
and
the
children
,
"
Alfred
Carter
said
.
"
It
will
keep
the
worst
of
the
weather
off
.
"
"
If
it
's
all
the
same
to
you
,
"
Ruth
said
,
"
I
'd
like
to
stay
outside
for
a
bit
.
At
any
rate
until
we
've
gone
through
the
locks
.
Perhaps
Enoch
would
like
to
watch
with
me
?
"
She
had
seen
locks
working
before
,
but
never
these
famous
"
five-rise
"
ones
,
the
longest
"
staircase
"
on
the
canal
.
She
stood
on
the
deck
while
the
water
rushed
in
through
the
sides
of
the
great
oaken
gates
,
lifting
the
barge
higher
and
higher
until
they
were
level
with
the
water
in
the
next
basin
.
Then
the
gates
opened
and
they
went
through
.
It
was
an
experience
to
be
repeated
many
times
as
the
canal
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
Pennines
.
"
If
you
think
that
's
exciting
,
"
Alfred
Carter
laughed
,
"
just
you
wait
until
you
go
through
the
tunnel
!
"
By
regular
standards
,
Ruth
supposed
,
the
canal
journey
was
uneventful
.
At
night
she
and
Charlotte
crowded
into
the
cabin
with
the
children
and
they
kept
each
other
warm
.
The
men
sheltered
under
a
tarpaulin
slung
across
the
corner
of
the
barge
.
To
relieve
the
tedium
of
the
days
they
sang
,
or
told
stories
to
Enoch
.
Sometimes
Alfred
allowed
Ruth
to
leave
the
barge
and
walk
beside
the
horse
on
the
towpath
,
to
stretch
her
legs
.
And
then
at
last
they
came
to
the
tunnel
.
At
the
entrance
a
small
boy
and
a
youth
were
waiting
.
"
Lead
yer
hoss
ower
the
top
,
mister
!
"
the
boy
shouted
.
"
Gi'
yer
a
hand
wi'
the
legging
!
"
the
youth
offered
.
Alfred
Carter
accepted
both
offers
.
Had
she
known
what
was
in
store
,
Ruth
thought
afterwards
,
she
would
have
begged
to
walk
over
the
top
with
the
horse
.
"
Now
,
"
Alfred
said
.
"
You
'll
not
like
this
next
bit

tunnel
's

mile
long

it
's

and
wet

two
ladies
would

cabin
wi'
the
children

"
Ruth
had
heard
about
"
legging
"
.
She
knew
all
about
it
in
theory
and
tried
to
explain
it
to
Enoch
.
"
You
lie
on
your
side
on
the
edge
of
the
barge
,
raise
your
legs
until
your
feet
touch
the
wall
,
and
then
make
a
walking
movement
.
You
have
to
push
hard
against
the
wall
to
drive
the
barge
forward

protested
.
"

into
the
cabin
or
not
?
"
"
Not

"
Ruth
replied
.
She
had
a
better
idea
.
She
turned
to
Alfred
Carter
.
"
I
'm
the
same
height

the
youth

she
said

astonishment

agreed

Ernest

took
one
side

Alfred

took
the
other
.

Ruth
tucked
up
her
skirts
and
clenched
her
teeth
,
and
as
Alfred
called
out
the
beat
she
pushed
hard
against
the
slippery
wall
,
and
was
relieved
and
delighted
to
feel
the
barge
moving
.
She
hated
every
minute
of
the
tunnel
:
the
thick
,
inky
darkness
,
the
icy
water
which
dripped
from
the
limestone
roof
;
the
dank
,
sour
smell
and
the
lack
of
air
.
When
the
first
shaft
of
light
showed
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
it
was
like
waking
from
a
nightmare

The
Flamingo
was
a
three-masted
ship
,
what
Ernest
described
as
"
square-rigged
"
.
Though
when
they
set
eyes
on
her
,
her
sails
were
furled
,
to
Ruth
she
looked
magnificent
.

in
pictures
,
she
had
never
seen
a
ship
.
"
It

such
a
beautiful

she
said
ecstatically
.
"
It
sounds
so
romantic

She
'll
be
like
a
great
bird
,
skimming
over
the
water
.
"
"
I
do
n't
care

Quacking
Duck

she
's

,
"
Charlotte
replied
.
The
dockside
was
the
busiest
place
Ruth
had
ever
seen
in
her
life
.
Between
passengers
waiting
to
board
,
porters
,
sailors
,
orange-sellers
,
touts
,
piled-up
cargo
,
there
was
scarcely
room
to
move
.
All
around
them
people
sat
on
their
boxes
and
held
on
to
precious
bundles
,
patiently
waiting
for
whatever
might
happen
next
.
Some
were
eating
,
and
Ruth
guessed
that
they
had
broken
into
the
food
supplies
they
had
brought
for
the
voyage
.
A
few
lay
on
the
ground
in
exhausted
or
inebriated
sleep
,
oblivious
to
children
and
dogs
who
clambered
over
them
,
or
to
the
kicks
from
porters
who
found
them
in
the
way
.
"
Why
ca
n't
we
go
on
board
?
"
Charlotte
asked
.
"
Do
we
have
to
stand
here
all
day
?
"
Jane
was
crying
;
a
fretful
whimper
,
as
if
she
was
struggling
to
fall
asleep
and
could
not
.
"
Here
,
let
me
take
her
,
"
Ruth
said
.
Somewhat
reluctantly
,
Charlotte
handed
over
her
daughter-
and
looked
displeased
when
the
baby
fell
asleep
almost
at
once
in
Ruth
's
arms
.
Ruth
could
never
understand
Charlotte
's
unwillingness
to
let
her
help
with
the
baby
.
It
seemed
as
though
she
liked
to
keep
those
she
loved
to
herself
,
as
if
by
sharing
,
some
part
of
them
would
be
lost
to
her
forever
.
"
I
'll
try
to
find
out
what
's
happening
,
"
Ernest
said
.
"
Do
n't
any
of
you
move
an
inch
from
here
and
do
n't
take
your
eyes
off
those
bundles

I
do
n't
doubt
this
place
is
full

rogues

"
He
sounded
irritable
,
which
was
unlike
him
.
He
had
been
brusque
and
taciturn
all
morning
,
giving
short
,
sharp
answers
to
Charlotte
's
questions
.
Ruth
could
almost
have
believed
that
he
wanted
to
turn
around
and
go
back
home
.
All
her
apprehensions
were
swallowed
up
in
excitement
,
but
then
she
did
not
have
the
responsibility
of
a
wife
and
family
.
But
when
Ernest
returned
he
sounded
a
little
more
hopeful
.
"
They
'll
still
loading
cargo

he
told
them
.
"
After

we
have

go

shop

get
our
health
certificates
.

's
it
yonder

"
He
pointed
to
a
hut
in
front
of
which
a
line
of
people
was
already
forming
.
"
We

he
said
.
"
It
might
be
a
long
business

"
Apart
from
waiting
in
the
queue
it
was
the
shortest
business
Ruth
had
ever
encountered
.
The
doctor
sat
at
the
open
window
of
the
hut
,
from
which
position
,
without
ever
moving
,
he
examined
the
passengers
.
He
scarcely
glanced
at
her
.
His
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
forms
which
he
was
signing
and
stamping
as
fast
as
he
could
go
.
"
Do
you
feel
well
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Never
better
.
"
"
Tongue
,
"
he
snapped
.
She
put
out
her
tongue
but
he
did
not
examine
it
.
He
was
already
handing
her
the
piece
of
paper
which
certified
that
she
was
in
good
health
and
not
suffering
from
any
infectious
disease
.
His
examination
of
her
cousins
was
every
bit
as
cursory
.
By
the
time
they
had
their
health
certificates
the
cargo
,
mostly
cotton
cloth
from
Manchester
,
had
been
stowed
.
"
Emigrants

"
Ernest
's
words
were
drowned
in
the
call
which
went
up
from
the
ship
,
and
the
outburst
of
cheering
from
the
Flamingo
's
passengers
.
"

Ruth

up

in

There
was
no
time
for

cousins

answer
.
Still
cheering
,
the
passengers
had
started
a
mad
rush
towards
the
gangway
,
shoving
and
pushing
at
anything
and
anybody
in
the
way

carrying
Enoch
on

batter
his
way
through

Enoch
began
to
cry
.
He
did
not
like
the
noise
,
and
all
these
people
pushing
him
.
"

others

Though
she
had
fallen
a
little
behind
she
managed
to
keep
her
cousins
in
sight
.
Then
suddenly
there
was
a
strong
wave
of
pressure
from
behind
,
as
if
all
the
world
was
at
her
back
.
She
felt
certain
that
she
must
fall
on
her
face
and
be
trampled
underfoot
.
She
was
more
frightened
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
,
but
fright
gave
her
strength
.
She
raised
her
arms
,
still
managing
to
cling
to
her
bundle
,
and
lashed
out
.
She
was
fighting
for
air
and
space
-
and
then
she
lost
her
balance
.
Miraculously
,
she
did
not
fall
down
.
The
crowd
was
so
thick
that
she
was
carried
along
with
it
.
But
she
was
losing
sight
of
her
family
.
"
Help

She
yelled
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
,
calling
again
and
again
until
at
last
he
heard
her
terrified
screams

With
difficulty
,
he
made
his
way
towards
her

Charlotte
clinging
to
him
for
dear
life

But
at
last
they
reached
the
top
of
the
crowded
gangway
.
Sailors
waiting
there
hauled
them
roughly
on
to
the
ship
,
not
caring
how
they
landed
.
In
front
of
Ruth
an
old
woman
,
not
moving
quickly
enough
to
please
them

was
thrown
so
heavily
that
she
landed
on
her
back
on
the
deck

was
too
winded
to
rise

"

Ruth
shouted
angrily
to
the
sailor
.
His
reply
was
to
give
her
a
sharp
pull
forward
and
then
a
shove
in
the
back
,
which
knocked
her
to
her
knees

foot

through

were
small
country
towns

rose
up
before
her

had
never

river

so
wide
that

would
have
mistaken
it
for
the
sea
,
was
full
of
craft
of
all
sizes

at

An
answer
came
unexpectedly
from
a
middle-aged
man
leaning
on
the
rail
nearby
.
At
least
she
thought
him
middle-aged
,
but
his
voice
was
n't
and
when
she
looked
at
him
again
she
saw
that
under
his
haggard
features
and
emaciated
frame
he
was
still
young
,
perhaps
in
his
late
twenties
.
He
spoke
with
a
strong
Irish
accent
,
soon
to
be
a
familiar
sound
on
board
since
most
of
the
emigrants
were
Irish
-
and
most
of
them
as
scrawny
and
hollow-cheeked
as
he
was
.
"
It
's
the
wind
which
is
contrary
,
"
the
man
told
her
.
"
Until
it
changes
the
ship
will
not
sail
.
"
"
Oh
but
the
Flamingo
sails
on
tomorrow
morning
's
tide
,
"
Ruth
informed
him
confidently
.
"
Only
if
the
wind
allows
,
"
he
said
,
smiling
at
her
ignorance
.
"
The
power
is
truly
in
the
wind
.
"
Ruth
thanked
him
for
his
information
and
a
few
minutes
later
he
raised
his
hat
and
walked
away
.
Enoch
grew
restless
,
so
they
walked
around
the
deck
until
he
decided
that
he
had
had
enough
and
that
only
his
mother
would
do
.
Ruth
did
not
enjoy
her
first
night
on
board
.
Modesty
forbade
her
to
undress
properly
and
get
into
her
nightshift
in
front
of
so
many
people
,
though
it
was
so
hot
below
decks
that
she
felt
obliged
to
take
off
her
top
skirt
and
her
blouse
.
Also
,
she
was
acutely
embarrassed
at
having
to
share
her
cousin
's
bed
,
especially
as
they
would
be
squeezed
so
closely
together
in
the
small
space
.
"
How
shall
we
arrange
ourselves
?
"
she
asked
.
"
The
baby
by
the
wall
.
Ernest
next
to
her
,
"
Charlotte
said
.
"
Then
me
,
then
Enoch
-
and
you
on
the
outside
.
"
"
And
what
if
the
baby
wants
feeding
?
"
Ernest
asked
.
"
Then
you
can
hand
her
over
to
me
.
"
It
was
impossible
to
stretch
out
,
let
alone
toss
and
turn
,
as
in
her
restlessness
Ruth
wanted
to
.
She
lay
rigid
,
not
allowing
herself
to
move
in
case
she
should
disturb
the
others
.
She
was
aware
,
though
no-one
spoke
,
that
for
much
of
the
time
Ernest
and
Charlotte
were
also
awake
.
At
one
time
she
felt
Charlotte
turn
towards
her
husband
,
and
knew
that
they
were
in
each
other
's
arms
.
There
was
plenty
of
sleep
going
on
around
her
.
The
snoring
rose
and
fell
like
an
ill-tuned
orchestra
,
interrupted
by
the
curses
of
those
who
,
like
herself
,
could
not
sleep
.
The
stuffiness
in
the
hold
was
made
worse
by
the
acrid
smell
of
unwashed
bodies
.
Not
far
from
her
a
man
retched
violently
-
thought
whether
from
sickness
,
since
they
were
scarcely
moving
,
or
from
drunkenness
,
she
did
not
know
.
Several
babies
cried
,
though
Jane
slept
well
.
Ruth
told
herself
that
once
they
were
at
sea
things
would
be
better
.
Then
towards
morning
,
she
fell
asleep
.
When
she
wakened
Ernest
was
already
up
and
dressed
.
"
A
happy
birthday
to
you
!
"
he
said
.
She
was
eighteen
years
old
.
"
The
wind
has
changed
,
"
he
told
her
.
"
It
's
blowing
from
the
east
now
.
They
say
that
if
it
keeps
up
we
shall
sail
on
time
.
"
"
And
once
we
're
at
sea
the
food
will
be
given
out
,
"
Ruth
said
.
"
We
have
n't
much
left
-
and
very
little
water
.
"
"
Well
then
,
if
we
want
to
say
goodbye
to
the
old
country
,
we
should
go
up
on
deck
,
"
Ernest
suggested
.
Charlotte
shook
her
head
.
"
I
'd
sooner
stay
where
I
am
.
Anyway
,
someone
has
to
look
after
our
belongings
else
they
might
get
pinched
.
It
'll
be
dog
eats
dog
on
this
voyage
!
"
In
any
case
,
she
had
no
ties
in
England
,
no-one
it
grieved
her
to
leave
.
And
no
matter
what
Ruth
said
,
she
did
feel
sick
.
She
would
like
to
go
to
sleep
now
and
not
wake
up
until
they
set
foot
in
America
.
Nothing
Ruth
had
ever
imagined
prepared
her
for
the
magnificence
of
that
day
's
scene
on
the
Mersey
,
though
she
saw
most
of
it
through
a
mist
of
tears
.
All
the
ships
,
large
and
small
,
which
had
been
held
up
for
days
past
,
had
now
unfurled
their
sails
and
were
putting
to
sea
.
As
the
Flamingo
herself
cast
off
and
manoeuvred
into
position
to
sail
down
the
broad
river
,
a
wild
cheer
went
up
from
the
emigrants
on
deck
.
She
reckoned
there
must
have
been
as
many
as
four
hundred
of
them
.
But
she
could
not
cheer
.
Instead
of
Liverpool
,
with
its
splendid
buildings
and
famous
docks
,
she
saw
,
first
Nordale
,
with
the
long
sweep
of
the
fells
,
and
the
river
running
through
the
valley
,
then
her
own
moorland
,
clothed
in
purple
heather
.
She
saw
it
all
as
plainly
as
if
it
had
been
magically
transported
from
Yorkshire
and
spread
out
on
the
quayside
,
the
moors
stretching
away
in
the
distance
until
they
met
the
skyline
.
And
then
she
saw
the
faces
of
her
aunt
and
uncle
,
her
father
and
her
grandfather
,
Maria
and
Willie
-
everyone
she
had
loved
and
still
loved
and
must
leave
behind
.
And
Dick
's
face
was
amongst
them
.
There
were
not
many
signs
of
sadness
on
deck
.
A
few
old
people
watched
with
impassive
faces
,
as
though
they
no
longer
felt
anything
,
but
most
of
the
people
were
in
high
spirits
,
talking
and
laughing
.
As
the
Flamingo
moved
down
the
river
the
wind
began
to
fill
the
sails
.
A
man
struck
up
a
tune
on
a
concertina
and
those
near
him
began
to
dance
.
Ernest
put
out
a
hand
and
touched
Ruth
's
arm
.
"
Do
n't
fret
,
love
!
The
best
is
yet
to
come
,
"
he
said
.
But
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
too
.
In
the
weeks
and
days
which
followed
Ruth
clung
to
those
words
of
Ernest
's
.
And
most
of
the
passengers
,
she
thought
,
must
have
relied
on
similar
thoughts
to
see
them
through
.
By
–passengers
'
she
meant
those
who
travelled
steerage
.
It
was
said
that
the
few
cabin
passengers
on
board
sailed
under
very
different
conditions
.
"
I
doubt
they
are
overcrowded
,
"
Ernest
remarked
.
"
Or
short
of
food
and
water
.
"
"
And
I
doubt
they
get
such
rough
treatment
from
the
crew
,
"
Ruth
said
angrily
.
"
They
would
n't
dare
treat
cabin
passengers
the
way
we
're
treated
!
"
She
wondered
if
the
cabin
passengers
caught
the
illnesses
-
especially
dysentery
-
which
were
rife
in
the
steerage
.
There
was
supposed
to
be
a
ship
's
doctor
aboard
but
no-one
below
decks
had
set
eyes
on
him
.
They
had
been
afloat
only
a
few
hours
when
a
seaman
shouted
down
the
hatch
.
"
Everybody
muster
on
deck
for
the
roll
call
!
Quick
about
it
,
I
ai
n't
got
all
day
!
"
There
were
cries
of
protest
,
for
though
the
sea
was
not
yet
rough
,
many
people
were
already
sick
,
and
unwilling
to
stir
.
"
Those
as
do
n't
muster
for
the
roll
call
do
n't
get
no
rations
,
"
the
seaman
shouted
.
"
No
roll
call
,
no
food
-
nor
water
neither
!
"
"
Food
is
the
last
thing
I
'm
interested
in

Charlotte
said
.
"
I
'd
rather
just
stay
here
.
"
"
You
ca
n't

that

"
Ernest
argued
.
"
It
's
not
just
food
,
it
's
water
as
well
.
We
ca
n't
afford
to
miss
the
water
ration
.
"
Reluctantly
she
dragged
herself
out
of
the
bunk
and
,
with
Ruth
carrying
the
baby
and
Ernest
holding
on
to
Enoch
,
they
went
on
deck
.
After
the
roll
call
the
third
mate
,
with
two
helpers
,
doled
out
the
rations
.
"
You
're
getting
oatmeal
,

he
shouted
.
"

"
It
sounded
well
enough
until
they
saw
the
size
of
the
rations
.
"
My
youngest
could
manage
that
lot
and
he
's
only

"
a
man
complained
.
"
It
's
no
good
to

grown
man
!
"
He
was
ignored
.
"
Drinking

day

"
the
third
mate
shouted
.
"
No

"
"
What
about
water
for
cooking
and
washing
?
"
a
woman
asked
.
"
There
's
plenty
of
sea
water
,
"
he
answered
.
"
Ready

.
"
"
Where

fresh
meat

were
promised

"
a
man
standing
near
to
Ruth
called
out
.
"
The

"
The
third
mate
glared
at
him
.
"

"
he
retorted
.
"
Them
that
makes
trouble
'll
get
none

"
Then
Ruth
saw
that
he
deliberately
gave
the
man
who
had
asked
the
question
only
half
the
bacon
ration
he
was
entitled
to
.
"
That
's
what
happens

awkward
questions

"
he
said
grimly
.
In
this
instance
it
mattered
little
.
There
were
enough
passengers
ready
to
believe
that
they
would
never
wish
to
eat
again
,
let
alone
eat
fat
bacon
.
"

Far
more

"
Good

someone
cried
.
"

said
.

"
No-one
believed
him

He
was
trying
to
frighten
them
.
After
all
,
they
had
paid
for
their
rations
;
they
were
entitled
to
them
.
Then
,
with
food
to
be
cooked
,
the
rush
for
the
stoves
began
.
There
were
four
stoves
situated
amidships
;
great
monsters
which
spat
out
showers
of
sparks
.
"
They
terrify
me

"
Ruth
said
.
"
Why
,
the
sparks
alone
could
set
the
whole
ship
alight
.
And
how
are
we
to
get
near
?
There
must
be
more
than
fifty
passengers
to
each
stove

Ernest
was
determined
.

'll

way
through

"
Ruth
had
volunteered
to
cook
the
first
meal
.
She
made
a
little
oatmeal
porridge
for
Enoch
,
and
for
the
three
adults
she
cooked
bacon
and
potatoes
,
in
the
iron
pan
they
had
brought
from
home
,
and
used
some
of
the
water
ration
to
make
tea
.
"
The
bacon

fresh

she
said
.
"
But
I
'm

"
So

Ernest
admitted
.
The
two
of
them
ate
well
,
but
Charlotte
could
not
face
the
meal
.
"
I
'll

said

looked
at
her
anxiously
.

Ruth
could
hardly
blame
her
.
With
the
lack
of
air
,
the
smells
,
the
unrestrained
vomiting
of
a
woman
in
the
top
bunk
(
why
had
she
ever
thought
they
were
lucky
to
get
a
bottom
bunk
?
)
it
took
real
hunger
and
a
strong
stomach
to
face
food
.
By
the
third
day
they
were
out
into
the
Atlantic
.
It
was
then
that
the
wind
changed
round
to
the
north-west
and
the
first
,
and
worst
,
of
the
storms
hit
the
Flamingo
.
The
sea
roared
like
a
pride
of
hungry
lions
,
thudding
against
the
side
of
the
ship
like
a
thousand
battering-rams
,
so
that
it
seemed
that
at
any
moment
it
must
break
through
and
drown
them
all
.
Ruth
tried
not
to
show
her
terror
when
the
timbers
creaked
and
moaned
like
tormented
spirits
and
she
could
hear
the
waves
breaking
on
the
deck
above
them
.
But
as
well
as
being
frightened
,
she
was
angry
.
She
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
after
all
they
had
gone
through
,
all
they
had
sacrificed
to
get
so
far
,
it
should
end
like
this
.
Would
they
ever
see
America
,
or
would
they
all
end
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
,
food
for
the
fishes
?
She
had
not
known
that
weather
like
this
existed
.
On
the
second
day
of
the
storm
a
seaman
bellowed
down
the
hatch
.
"
No
rations
until
the
storm
's
over
!
"
"
What
about
the
water
?
"
someone
called
.
"
No
water
neither
.
Not
until
the
storm
bates
!
"
His
words
were
lost
in
the
frightened
screams
of
the
women
,
the
crying
of
terrified
children
,
the
loud
cursing
and
swearing
-
and
sometimes
praying
-
of
the
men
.
Ruth
wanted
,
physically
,
to
hit
back
at
the
storm–
which
went
on
and
on
,
which
was
striking
at
her
.
At
her
worst
,
on
the
third
night
,
faint
from
lack
of
food
,
her
throat
parched
with
thirst
,
she
had
a
crazy
idea
that
the
storm
was
singling
her
out
for
punishment
,
was
expending
its
venom
to
get
at
her
.
She
hated
it
.
She
hated
it
as
if
it
was
a
personal
devil
.
She
was
no
longer
aware
of
the
people
around
her
,
only
of
herself
and
the
storm
.
At
the
height
of
her
anger
,
unable
to
stop
herself
,
she
beat
a
loud
tattoo
with
her
clenched
fists
on
the
wooden
edge
of
the
bunk
.
"
Stop
it
,
damn
you
!
Stop
it
!
"
Her
cries
and
thumps
awakened
both
children
,
and
when
they
started
to
cry
,
Charlotte
screamed
at
her
.
"
What
do
you
think
you
're
doing
?
"
"
I
'm
sorry

Charlotte
cried
.
"

any
worse
for
you

Why
do
you

so
special

"
Ernest
tried
to
calm
down
both
women
.
"
Hush
now
.
We
must
try
to
sleep
if
we
can
.
"
Ruth
came
quickly
to
her
senses
.
But
there
was
no
stopping
Charlotte
and
Ruth
realised
,
as
the
words
poured
out
of
her
,
that
she
was
releasing
the
pent-up
feelings
of
many
months
.
"
I
wo
n't
hush
!
"
she
shouted
,
turning
on
Ernest
.
"
Tell
her
to
hush

Why
is
she
allus
right

places

,
so

night

Ernest
clapped
a
hand
over
her
mouth
.
"
Stop
it

he
commanded
.
"
You

"
Ruth
struggled
out
of
the
bunk
and
,
wrapping
herself
in
her
shawl
,
she
lay
on
the
floor
.
She
was
already
dressed
,
they
all
were
,
in
preparation
for
the
shipwreck
which
they
felt
sure
must
come
.
For
the
moment
she
was
so
shocked
by
Charlotte
's
naked
,
sexual
jealousy
that
she
forgot
to
be
frightened
by
the
storm
.
From
now
on
,
though
she
knew
of
nowhere
else
where
she
could
sleep
,
she
resolved
never
to
share
her
cousin
's
berth
again
.
And
as
far
as
possible
she
would
keep
her
distance
from
Ernest
.
She
was
unaware
of
any
undue
familiarity
between
herself
and
her
cousin
;
they
seemed
as
they
had
always
seemed
since
childhood
.
But
she
would
take
no
chances
.
But
what
of
the
future
,
she
thought
,
Alas
there
on
the
floor
?
It
was
clear
that
she
was
n't
wanted
by
Charlotte
,
and
if
Ernest
did
want
her
with
them
,
then
that
would
only
make
matters
worse
.
She
felt
totally
and
truly
alone
.
And
when
the
woman
in
the
top
bunk
threw
up
again
and
the
sour
vomit
splashed
down
on
her
and
soaked
her
skirt
,
it
was
the
last
straw
.
She
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
burst
into
bitter
tears
.
She
had
to
get
out
.
No
matter
how
bad
the
storm
was
she
had
to
go
on
deck
,
where
at
least
the
air
was
clean
.
But
because
of
the
storm
the
hatches
had
been
battened
down
and
no
matter
how
hard
she
searched
she
could
not
find
a
way
out
of
the
hold
.
But
she
did
find
an
unoccupied
corner
of
the
floor
,
away
from
everyone
she
knew
.
There
she
stayed
until
morning
.
Soon
after
dawn
the
storm
suddenly
abated
.
Ruth
was
there
waiting
when
the
hatches
were
raised
and
she
escaped
at
once
and
went
up
on
deck
.
Although
,
officially
,
steerage
passengers
were
only
allowed
there
at
certain
times
,
no-one
took
any
notice
if
a
few
people
walked
the
deck
.
Curiously
,
there
were
very
few
who
availed
themselves
of
this
privilege
.
The
stench
which
rose
from
below
,
to
where
Ruth
stood
at
the
top
of
the
hatchway
,
was
worse
than
anything
she
could
ever
have
imagined
.
Dysentery
among
the
passengers
continued
and
during
the
storm
almost
everyone
had
been
sick
,
so
that
with
the
lack
of
sanitation
the
steerage
was
truly
awash
.
And
then
the
smell
did
something
that
the
worst
fury
of
the
storm
had
failed
to
do
.
Ruth
felt
her
stomach
heave
,
and
rushed
to
the
side
of
the
ship
,
where
she
was
violently
sick
over
the
rail
.
When
it
was
over
she
raised
her
head
and
breathed
in
deeply
.
The
air
up
here
was
clean
and
fresh
.
The
wind
had
,
by
comparison
,
almost
dropped
,
and
the
March
sun
made
a
path
of
gold
across
the
water
.
Had
it
not
been
for
splintered
wood
and
debris
Alas
on
deck
,
and
a
ripped
sail
or
two
,
the
storm
might
have
seemed
no
more
than
a
bad
dream
.
She
was
standing
by
the
ship
's
rail
,
thinking
about
Charlotte
's
outburst
,
worrying
about
what
she
should
do
,
when
she
heard
a
woman
speaking
to
her
.
"
I
asked
,
are
you
all
right
?
"
the
woman
said
.
She
was
standing
by
a
part
of
the
deck
which
jutted
out
above
the
place
where
Ruth
stood
,
by
which
Ruth
knew
that
the
woman
was
a
cabin
passenger
.
No-one
from
the
steerage
was
allowed
up
there
.
"
All
right
?
"
"
Yes
.
How
have
you
weathered
the
storm
?
Was
it
awful
down
there
?
"
"
It
was
,
"
Ruth
said
.
"
It
was
terrible
.
But
I
'm
all
right
-
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
some
.
"
"
I
wanted
to
come
down
.
Before
the
storm
,
I
mean
,
to
see
if
there
was
anything
I
could
do
.
Neither
the
captain
nor
my
husband
would
let
me
.
They
said
it
was
n't
fit
.
"
"
It
is
n't
,
"
Ruth
agreed
.
"
There
are
four
hundred
people
down
there
.
It
is
n't
fit
for
them
.
"
The
woman
flushed
,
though
Ruth
had
n't
meant
to
rebuke
her
.
"
I
've
seen
you
on
deck
with
your
husband
and
little
boy
,
"
she
said
.
"
Are
they
well
?
"
"
Quite
well
,
thank
you
-
though
he
's
my
cousin
,
not
my
husband
,
and
the
child
is
his
.
His
wife
suffers
badly
from
seasickness
and
keeps
mostly
to
her
berth
.
"
"
Poor
soul
,
"
the
woman
said
.
Then
:
"
I
have
a
little
girl
on
board
.
I
must
go
to
her
now
.
Perhaps
I
shall
see
you
again
-
and
please
tell
me
if
there
is
anything
I
can
do
.
"
After
that
,
since
she
now
spent
as
much
time
as
possible
on
deck
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
her
cousins
,
with
whom
she
felt
a
constraint
,
Ruth
saw
the
woman
for
several
days
in
a
row
.
Once
or
twice
Ruth
took
Enoch
with
her
and
on
one
occasion
the
woman
on
the
upper
deck
was
accompanied
by
a
little
girl
.
"
This
is
my
daughter
,
Anna
,
"
she
said
.
The
child
was
about
five
years
old
,
fair-haired
,
immaculately
dressed
,
and
seemingly
friendly
.
"
Would
you
like
a
sweetmeat
,
little
boy
?
"
she
called
out
to
Enoch
-
and
threw
one
down
to
him
.
"
How
are
things
going
,
"
the
woman
asked
.
"
Badly
.
Our
rations
have
been
cut
again
,
"
Ruth
said
.
"
We
're
receiving
no
fresh
meat
at
all
,
and
not
enough
water
.
Also
,
there
's
a
great
deal
of
sickness
for
which
we
need
medicines
.
I
know
the
ship
is
supposed
to
carry
a
doctor
,
but
he
does
n't
come
near
us
.
I
dare
say
he
's
afraid
to
,
for
fear
of
catching
something
!
"
"
What
can
I
do
?
"
the
woman
asked
.
"
Well
for
a
start
,
madam
,
you
could
tell
the
captain
.
I
feel
sure
he
must
already
know
,
since
it
's
his
ship
,
but
it
might
be
good
for
him
to
realise
that
persons
of
influence
,
like
yourself
,
who
might
report
him
,
also
knew
.
He
wo
n't
care
about
any
of
us
,
of
course
.
"
For
two
days
after
their
conversation
Ruth
did
not
see
the
woman
,
and
then
on
the
third
day
a
man
leaned
over
from
the
upper
deck
and
called
out
to
her
.
"
Are
you
the
young
woman
my
wife
,
Mrs
Carson
,
knows

"
he
asked
.
"
You
answer
her
description
.
"
'I
expect
so
,

Ruth
answered
.
"
I
do
n't
know

lady

I
have
n't

two
days

I
hope
she
's
well

"
"
She

not
well

he
said
.
"
She

a
chill
and
is
confined
to
bed
.
So
is
our
daughter

have
been
sent
to
ask
you
whether
,
if
I
can
arrange
it
with
the
captain

you
would
consent
to
look

"
"
I
would
be
pleased

Ruth
replied
.
"
Then
come
back
to
this
same
place
in
an
hour
's
time
,

have

Ruth
hurried
back
to
the
berth
,
gave
Ernest
and
Charlotte
the
news
,
and
began
to
make
herself
as
tidy
as
she
could
.
"
It
might
be
interesting

she
said
.

Ernest
said
,
"

they

have
a

Ruth
promised
.
Charlotte
had
her
mind
on
other
things
.
"
There
's
a
baby
four
berths

playing
with

's
something
bad

What

What

Enoch

baby
take
it

Her
voice
was
hoarse
with
anxiety
.
"

it

Ernest
tried
to
comfort
his
wife
,
but
Ruth
saw
the
anxiety
in
his
eyes
.
She
went
back
on
deck
at
the
appointed
time
and
within
a
minute
the
man
appeared
.
"

you
come
up
here

"
he
called
out
.
"
I
'll
take
you
to
my
wife
's
cabin
.
"
Their
quarters
turned
out
to
be
a
small
suite
,
with
two
sleeping
cabins
and
a
minute
dining-room
.
Mrs
Carson
,
Alas
in
a
bunk
with
a
blanket
thrown
over
her
,
was
clearly
relieved
to
see
Ruth
.
"
Anna
and
I
are
much
better
,
"
she
said
.
"
Especially
Anna
.
But
I
have
told
her
all
the
stories

rhymes
I
know

she
is
getting
bored
.
Also
,
I
should
dearly
love
to
rest
.
Could
you
come
for
a
few
hours
each
day
,
do
you
think
?
"
For
the
next
few
days
Ruth
spent
most
of
her
waking
hours
with
Anna
,
reading
to
her
from
the
small
collection
of
books
Mrs
Carson
had
brought
on
board
,
playing
games
,
making
up
stories
.
From
the
first
she
took
her
meals
with
Anna
.
Food
was
plentiful
and
there
was
as
much
water
to
drink
as
she
wanted
.
At
the
end
of
the
first
day
Ruth
presented
herself
to
Mrs
Carson
.
"
If
you
please
,
ma'am
-
?
"
"
What
is
it
,
Ruth
?
Is
Anna
misbehaving
?
"
"
Not
at
all
,
ma'am
.
We
get
on
well
together
.
It
's
just
-
"
She
hesitated
.
"
Well
?
"
"
Well
ma'am
,
there
's
some
scraps
of
food
left
over
and
-
it
's
bold
of
me
to
say
so
-
but
if
it
was
going
to
be
wasted
I
know
my
cousins
would
feel
the
benefit
.
They
've
cut
our
rations
again
.
But
only
if
it
was
going
begging
of
course
!
"
"
Why
,
Ruth
,
of
course
you
may
take
it
!
"
Mrs
Carson
exclaimed
.
"
You
may
take
whatever
is
left
over
at
the
end
of
each
day
.
I
am
quite
distressed
to
think
of
your
family
going
hungry
!
"
So
for
three
days
Ruth
took
food
,
and
sometimes
water
,
to
her
cousins
,
and
since
the
food
was
of
a
better
variety
,
Charlotte
was
tempted
into
eating
.
"
And
you
will
have
my
rations
,
since
I
do
n't
need
them
,
"
Ruth
told
Ernest
.
He
shook
his
head
.
"
They
've
stopped
your
rations
.
They
reckon
you
're
not
due
,
since
you
're
eating
with
your
employers
.
"
On
the
fourth
morning
of
their
arrangement
Ruth
presented
herself
to
Mrs
Carson
as
usual
-
but
to
a
troubled
looking
lady
.
"
I
'm
afraid
our
little
arrangement
must
come
to
an
end
,
Ruth
,
"
she
said
at
once
.
Ruth
could
hardly
believe
it
.
"
But
why
,
ma'am
?
Have
I
not
given
satisfaction
?
"
"
Most
certainly
you
have
,
"
Mrs
Carson
answered
.
"
I
am
more
than
pleased
with
you
.
But
the
captain
has
informed
me
that
there
is
a
case
of
smallpox
in
the
steerage
.
A
baby
,
poor
little
mite
.
It
would
not
be
safe
to
have
you
going
to
and
fro
between
the
steerage
and
our
quarters
.
You
do
see
that
,
do
n't
you
?
"
Ruth
felt
sick
at
heart
.
It
was
bad
enough
having
to
sleep
in
the
steerage
-
lying
on
the
floor
wherever
she
could
find
a
place
,
where
cockroaches
and
rats
could
run
over
her
while
she
slept
.
To
go
back
to
spending
her
days
there
was
unendurable
.
There
must
be
some
way
out
of
it
!
"
Would
it
be
possible
-
"
she
began
.
"
Yes
?
"
"
I
mean
,
if
I
did
n't
go
back
to
steerage
?
If
I
never
went
back
until
the
end
of
the
voyage
,
could
I
stay
with
Miss
Anna
?
Look
after
her
all
the
time
?
And
you
too
!
There
are
lots
of
things
I
could
do
for
you
,
ma'am
.
I
'm
good
with
my
needle
.
"
Heaven
help
her
if
that
lie
were
put
to
the
test
!
"
I
would
n't
want
payment
,
and
I
'd
sleep
on
the
floor
-
anywhere
!
"
Mrs
Carson
looked
at
her
husband
.
"
I
'm
fit
and
well
,
"
Ruth
told
them
eagerly
.
"
The
doctor
could
examine
me
if
you
wished
.
"
"
You
do
realise
,
"
Mrs
Carson
said
,
"
that
you
would
not
be
able
to
see
your
cousins
at
all
until
we
reached
New
York
?
Not
even
if
they
were
ill
.
Especially
not
if
they
were
ill
.
"
"
I
do
n't
think
they
'd
miss
me
,
"
Ruth
confessed
.
"
In
fact
the
arrangement
might
be
a
relief
to
them
-
except
for
the
extra
food
.
"
Which
would
in
any
case
,
cease
,
she
thought
,
if
she
could
no
longer
work
for
the
Carsons
.
"
Well
,
if
you
're
quite
sure
,
"
Mrs
Carson
said
.
"
But
I
should
not
want
you
to
go
back
there
at
all
,
not
until
we
are
ready
to
disembark
.
And
from
this
very
moment
.
I
should
require
you
to
send
a
note
to
your
cousins
by
one
of
the
crew
.
He
could
bring
back
those
of
your
possessions
you
will
need
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
.
"
Charlotte
,
Ruth
thought
as
she
penned
the
note
,
would
be
delighted
.
And
though
Ernest
might
not
be
so
pleased
,
it
would
make
matters
easier
for
him
.
Enoch
would
miss
her
most
,
and
she
him
.
So
she
joined
the
Carson
household
and
settled
with
them
.
The
days
passed
happily
enough
but
at
night
,
in
the
tiny
cabin
she
shared
with
Anna
,
she
sometimes
lay
awake
and
thought
of
her
cousins
,
down
below
in
that
hell-hole
.
And
she
knew
that
if
she
had
been
made
welcome
from
the
start
,
she
would
still
want
to
be
with
them
,
in
spite
of
this
comparative
luxury
.
If
she
could
have
been
part
of
a
warm
,
loving
family
,
it
was
what
she
would
have
liked
most
of
all
.
But
she
was
not
wanted
and
knew
she
never
would
be
.
It
had
been
a
mistake
ever
to
force
herself
upon
them
.
"
Mr
Carson
's
father
has
a
prosperous
cotton
business
in
Manchester
,
"
Mrs
Carson
said
one
day
in
her
friendly
manner
.
"
My
husband
is
going
to
New
York
to
make
new
contacts
.
I
know
I
shall
enjoy
our
time
there
.
They
say
there
is
most
interesting
society
,
with
lots
of
concerts
and
plays
and
cultural
pursuits
.
And
of
course
there
is
a
great
deal
of
money
to
be
made
.
"
Ruth
drew
a
deep
breath
,
summoned
all
her
courage
,
and
blurted
out
the
question
which
had
been
churning
in
her
mind
day
and
night
for
some
time
.
"
Could
I
go
to
New
York
with
you
,
ma'am
?
Could
I
work
for
you
?
I
would
do
any
job
you
wished
,
and
to
the
very
best
of
my
ability
,
if
only
you
'd
give
me
the
chance
.
"
She
felt
herself
growing
hot
at
her
own
temerity
,
but
Mrs
Carson
showed
very
little
surprise
.
"
I
've
been
expecting
you
to
ask
me
that
question
,
"
she
admitted
.
"
But
surely
you
wish
to
go
to
Wisconsin
with
your
cousins
?
And
would
it
not
be
much
wiser
,
for
your
sake
,
to
do
so
?
"
Ruth
told
her
something
of
the
situation
between
herself
and
her
cousins
.
"
But
Mr
Carson
and
I
are
only
in
New
York
for
a
year
,
"
Mrs
Carson
pointed
out
.
"
What
would
you
do
at
the
end
of
that
time
?
"
"
Something
will
turn
up
,
"
Ruth
said
with
confidence
.
"
And
if
it
does
n't
,
I
promise
I
will
join
my
cousins
.
Things
might
be
better
between
us
after
an
absence
.
You
will
not
need
to
have
me
on
your
conscience
.
"
"
I
must
confess
,
"
Mrs
Carson
smiled
,
"
that
I
would
like
to
keep
you
with
us
.
I
have
said
as
much
to
Mr
Carson
.
If
you
were
not
to
accompany
us
I
would
have
to
find
someone
in
New
York
.
It
would
be
pleasant
to
have
an
English
girl
and
Anna
is
already
fond
of
you
.
"
"
And
I

her
,
"
Ruth
said
.
So
it
was
arranged
.
At
breakfast
on
the
day
before
they
were
due
to
arrive
in
New
York
Mrs
Carson
said
,
"
I
think
you
could
go
below
and
see
your
cousins
today
.
The
doctor
tells
me
that
the
danger
of
smallpox
is
now
past
.
"
More
than
one
person
had
died
,
and
been
buried
at
sea
,
but
it
was
the
funeral
of
the
baby
who
was
berthed
near
to
her
cousins
which
affected
Ruth
most
.
Not
only
was
it
the
first
death
,
but
it
could
easily
have
been
little
Enoch
,
or
Jane
.
The
ship
's
carpenter
had
sewn
the
tiny
body
into
canvas
,
weighting
it
at
the
feet
with
coal
,
so
that
it
would
sink
rapidly
.
Everyone
on
board
who
was
free
to
do
so
had
attended
the
funeral
,
Ruth
standing
with
the
Carsons
on
the
upper
deck
.
A
porthole
was
opened
amidships
and
on
a
plank
lay
the
small
body
.
The
captain
read
the
funeral
service
and
the
first
mate
raised
the
plank
and
tipped
the
small
bundle
into
the
water
.
It
floated
for
a
second
and
then
sank
.
Ruth
thought
she
would
never
forget
the
bereaved
mother
's
demented
scream
.
"
Tell
your
cousins
what
you
have
decided
,
"
Mrs
Carson
said
.
"
See
if
they
approve
.
"
When
Ruth
went
down
to
the
lower
deck
it
was
a
hive
of
activity
,
with
the
strangest
thing
she
had
so
far
seen
taking
place
.
Men
,
women
,
and
all
except
the
smallest
children
,
were
on
their
hands
and
knees
,
busily
washing
every
inch
of
the
deck
,
supervised
by
the
third
mate
and
half
a
dozen
rough-looking
sailors
,
who
kept
them
at
it
every
second
.
She
found
Ernest
and
Charlotte
on
their
knees
with
the
rest
,
with
Enoch
,
as
far
as
a
three-year-old
could
,
keeping
an
eye
on
the
baby
nearby
.
"
What
in
the
world
is
happening
?
"
Ruth
enquired
.
"
You
may
well
ask

Ernest
replied
bitterly
.
"
Of
course
you
would
n't
know

would
you

Charlotte
said
with
asperity
.
"
Now

're
a
cabin
passenger

"
What
is
it
?
"
Ruth
persisted
.
"
The
steerage
passengers
have
been
ordered
to
scrub
every
bit
of
the
deck
so
that
it
's
clean
for
the
quarantine
inspection

Ernest
explained
.
"
There
's

more
water
used

floor

to
wash
ourselves
and
our
clothes
in
since
we
left
Liverpool

"
"
I
'm
sorry
,
"
Ruth
said
.
"
That
's
terrible
.
And
I
would
willingly
get
down
and
help
you
,
but
Mrs
Carson
is
waiting
for
me
.
"
"
We
do
n't
need
your

Charlotte
retorted
quickly
.
Ernest
sat
back
on
his
heels
.
"
Anyhow
,
we
're
about
finished
,
"
he
said
more
reasonably
.
Charlotte
stood
up
,
drying
her
hands
on
her
skirt
.
Ruth
was
dismayed
to
see
how
thin
she
had
grown
.
Both
she
and
Ernest
had
lost
weight
during
the
voyage
,
but
Charlotte
could
ill
spare
it
.
Ruth
told
them
her
news
.
"
You
've
done
mighty
well
for
yourself
,
I
must
say
!
"
Charlotte
remarked
.
"
But
you
do
n't
want
me
with
you
,
Charlotte
!
You
never
did
.
Admit
it
!
"
Charlotte
refused
to
answer
,
but
Ruth
knew
she
was
right
.
Ernest
was
torn
two
ways
.
"
I
daresay
thou
'll
be
all
right
.
I
would
n't
let
you
do
it
else
.
But
we
shall
miss
thee
,
Ruth
;
Charlotte
,
as
well
as
me
and
the
children
.
So
promise
thou
'll
come
to
us
when
the
year
is
up
.
Promise
!
"
Ruth
's
eyes
met
his
.
If
you
only
knew
how
much
I
long
to
come
with
you
now
,
she
thought
.
But
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
.
"
I
promise
I
'll
consider
it
,
"
she
told
him
.
"
And
remember
,
I
shall
send
my
share
of
the
Emigrant
Society
's
dues
every
quarter
out
of
my
wages

I

"
When
Ruth
wakened
on
the
morning
of
May
the
tenth
her
first
thought
was
that
this
,
God
willing
,
was
the
day
they
would
sail
into
New
York
harbour
.
She
wakened
Anna
and
dressed
her
and
the
two
of
them
went
on
deck
.
The
lower
deck
,
shining
clean
now
,
was
thronged
with
steerage
passengers
.
They
had
somehow
spruced
themselves
up
,
dressed
in
whatever
was
their
best
,
collected
their
belongings
together
,
and
now
waited
to
go
forward
into
their
new
lives
.
The
man
with
the
concertina
,
whom
Ruth
had
noticed
on
the
day
they
sailed
from
Liverpool
,
struck
up
a
tune
;
only
this
time
it
was
not
a
dance
,
but
a
hymn
of
thanksgiving
and
praise
,
in
which
everyone
joined
.
"
All
people
that
on
earth
do
dwell
,
Sing
to
the
Lord
with
cheerful
voice
-
"
The
sound
grew
and
swelled
,
as
the
singers
somehow
found
new
strength
to
praise
their
God
,
until
the
ship
was
filled
with
their
harmonies
.
Ruth
,
looking
down
from
the
upper
deck
,
her
hand
clasped
around
Anna
's
,
lifted
her
clear
soprano
voice
with
the
rest
,
though
it
was
difficult
to
sing
because
of
the
tight
aching
in
her
throat
and
the
tears
which
pricked
at
her
eyes
.
She
caught
sight
of
Ernest
and
Charlotte
in
the
crowd
and
at
the
same
time
they
saw
her
.
When
they
waved
to
her
,
and
held
up
little
Enoch
to
see
her
better
,
she
could
no
longer
keep
back
the
blinding
tears
.
She
saw
the
scene
in
front
of
her
through
a
mist
.
The
ship
was
sailing
into
the
harbour
now
.
It
looked
quite
different
from
Liverpool
,
and
not
only
because
the
sun
was
shining
.
There
were
scores
of
boats
and
ships
of
every
kind
,
with
a
forest
of
masts
and
rigging
outlined
against
the
clear
blue
sky
.
A
cacophony
of
ships'sirens
filled
the
air
.
The
sun
shone
over
everything
,
sparkling
on
the
water
,
and
what
with
that
and
her
own
tears
it
seemed
to
Ruth
that
the
sea
was
scattered
with
diamonds
.
In
spite
of
her
grief
at
being
parted
from
her
cousins
,
she
could
not
help
but
feel
excited
.
There
was
something
in
the
air
,
an
energy
,
a
vibrancy
,
which
she
had
never
experienced
before
.
It
filled
her
,
lifted
her
spirits
,
and
she
remembered
Ernest
's
words
,
and
said
them
out
loud
to
the
little
girl
beside
her
.
"
The
best
is
yet
to
be
,
Anna
!
The
best
is
yet
to
be
!
"
Her
words
were
carried
away
on
the
breeze
,
to
join
the
tumult
of
sounds
.
She
felt
sure
and
confident
that
they
were
true
.
Mr
and
Mrs
Carson
joined
them
.
"
I
am
afraid
we
shall
not
see
your
cousins
when
we
disembark
,
Ruth
,
"
Mrs
Carson
said
.
"
The
steerage
passengers
must
go
through
quarantine
,
which
I
'm
afraid
will
delay
them
considerably
.
For
cabin
passengers
,
of
course
,
it
is
not
necessary
.
"
"
So
now
that
we
have
been
here
almost
three
months
,
"
Mrs
Carson
said
,
"
what
do
you
think
of
New
York
,
Ruth
?
"
She
was
not
really
looking
for
an
answer
.
She
was
concentrating
on
her
appearance
,
adding
the
finishing
touches
before
setting
out
on
yet
another
shopping
expedition
.
The
Carsons
had
quickly
made
friends
.
They
were
a
pleasant
,
handsome
couple
and
New
York
had
welcomed
them
,
showering
them
with
invitations
.
Naturally
,
all
this
activity
made
it
necessary
for
Mrs
Carson
to
renew
her
whole
wardrobe
.
Everything
she
had
brought
from
Manchester
now
seemed
so
provincial
.
New
York
was
so
chic
,
so
fashionable
.
"
What
do
I
think
of
it
?
"
Ruth
smiled
,
"
Why
,
ma'am
,
I
think
it
's
wonderful
!
Incredible
!
It
's
so
exciting
.
"
She
had
felt
the
excitement
in
the
air
the
minute
she
had
stepped
off
the
boat
.
Her
whole
body
tingled
with
it
.
She
just
knew
,
she
knew
with
absolute
certainty
,
that
in
this
vast
,
noisy
,
busy
city
,
something
would
happen
to
her
,
and
it
was
bound
to
be
something
good
.
Life
,
from
now
on
,
was
going
to
be
quite
different
from
anything
she
had
ever
known
.
Adventure
awaited
her
around
every
corner
.
"
And
so
big
,
so
busy
.
Five
hundred
thousand
people
,
Professor
Woodburn
says
there
are
.
Sometimes
I
think
they
're
all
on
Broadway
at
the
same
time
!
"
She
adored
Broadway
.
The
shops
-
so
many
,
such
variety
!
A
person
with
money
could
buy
just
about
anything
.
And
the
hotels
!
Splendid
buildings
with
grand
entrances
and
such
smart
people
going
in
and
out
that
it
was
a
pleasure
just
to
stand
and
watch
them
.
She
had
dared
to
step
inside
Mr
Brady
's
photographic
establishment
to
view
the
wonderful
daguerreotypes
and
portraits
he
had
taken
.
The
very
best
people
went
to
him
and
it
was
her
intention
,
once
she
had
saved
the
necessary
two
dollars
,
to
do
likewise
.
She
told
herself
she
wanted
to
have
her
photograph
taken
so
that
she
could
send
it
to
Aunt
Sarah
,
but
really
it
was
for
herself
.
She
was
curious
to
know
how
she
looked
to
other
people
.
"
I
could
never
tire
of
New
York

she
said
.
"
Not

a
lifetime

"
Good

"
Mrs
Carson
replied
absently
.
Would
her
bonnet
take
more
ribbon
,
or
perhaps
a
flower
or
two
,
to
give
her
height
?
"
And
now
I
absolutely
must

So
much

Everything

early

things

"
They
had
been
invited
to
spend
a
week
or
two
at
the
country
house
of
Mr
Josiah
Barnet
,
a
banker
on
Wall
Street
,
whom
Mr
Carson
had
met
in
the
course
of
business
.
Mr
Barnet
was
rich
.
His
wile
,
it
was
said
,
was
even
more
so
,
and
well-connected
.
They
were
lucky
,
Mrs
Carson
declared
,
to
have
received
such
an
invitation
.
There
was
no
knowing
who
they
might
meet
there
.
"
I
'm
afraid
it
's
very
hot
again
,
"
she
said
.
"
Perhaps
you
should
not
take
Anna
out
today
.
But
use
your
own
judgement
.
"
Ruth
was
a
sensible
girl
.
She
could
safely
leave
Anna
in
her
care
.
When
Mrs
Carson
had
left
,
Ruth
suggested
,
"
I
think
you
ought
to
have
a
little
nap
,
Anna
.
After
that
we
'll
go
out

it
's
not
too
hot

"
"
Can
we
go
to
Wagner
's
ice-cream
parlour
?
"
Anna
asked
.
"
We
'll
see
.
For
now
you
must
lie
down
on
the
bed
and
go
to
sleep
.
"
Anna
was
asleep
in
ten
minutes
.
Ruth
sat
down
and
took
a
letter
from
her
pocket
.
Before
they
had
parted
on
the
Flamingo
she
had
given
Ernest
the
name
of
the
boardinghouse
where
the
Carsons
had
made
arrangements
to
stay
,
and
he
had
promised
to
write
to
her
the
minute
he
and
Charlotte
arrived
at
their
destination
.
A
dozen
times
since
then
Ruth
had
visited
the
post
office
in
Nassau
Street
,
but
no
letter
came
.
Sometimes
she
wondered
whether
her
cousins
were
still
alive
.
They
could
have
been
attacked
by
Indians
;
they
could
have
run
out
of
food
and
water
and
suffered
a
terrible
death
by
starvation
.
Or
perhaps
they
were
still
wandering
in
that
long
stretch
of
country
which
lay
between
New
York
and
the
State
of
Wisconsin
?
"
You
are
letting
your
imagination
run
away
with
you
,
"
Mrs
Carson
had
said
.
And
yesterday
she
had
been
proved
right
.
When
Ruth
called
yet
again
at
the
post
office
a
letter
was
waiting
for
her
.
Now
,
while
Anna
slept
,
she
read
it
for
the
tenth
time
.
"
We
are
fit
and
well
,
"
(
Ernest
wrote
)
.
"
Little
Jane
thrives
,
as
do
we
all
.
Charlotte
did
not
enjoy
the
journey
up
the
Hudson
River
and
through
the
Canal
,
nor
the
horse-drawn
wagon
which
followed
.
She
is
with
child
and
the
bumping
added
to
her
sickness
.
Everything
is
different
from
Ilkley
though
we
have
met
up
with
a
family
from
Leeds
,
which
makes
it
more
like
home
.
"
When
she
first
read
the
letter
,
standing
out
there
in
the
heat
of
Nassau
Street
,
Ruth
was
overcome
by
a
pang
of
homesickness
so
severe
that
it
felt
like
a
pain
burning
inside
her
.
It
was
strange
that
,
truly
enamoured
of
New
York
as
she
was
,
she
could
still
feel
like
this
-
choked
with
a
desire
to
hear
the
broad
vowels
of
her
native
Yorkshire
.
There
was
a
score
of
different
accents
and
tongues
around
her
as
she
stood
there
,
but
not
the
one
she
wanted
.
Today
she
felt
better
.
So
Charlotte
was
to
have
another
baby
?
Somehow
in
the
confines
of
that
tossing
,
stinking
ship
her
cousins
had
managed
to
make
love
,
perhaps
even
when
she
was
Alas
with
them
.
No
wonder
Charlotte
hated
her
.
There
had
been
no
mention
in
Ernest
's
letter
of
Aunt
Sarah
.
Ruth
had
written
to
her
four
times
and
lived
in
the
hope
that
her
aunt
would
get
the
minister
to
reply
.
She
had
also
written
to
Willie
and
Maria
,
even
to
Mrs
Johnson
.
Though
she
was
not
really
homesick
,
penning
the
letters
somehow
kept
her
close
.
Anna
stirred
in
her
sleep
,
opened
her
eyes
slowly
.
"
Are
we
going
out
now
?
"
she
asked
.
"
Not
yet
.
It
's
still
very
hot
.
"
"
Tell
me
about
where
we
're
going
tomorrow
then
,
"
Anna
demanded
.
"
I
've
told
you

dozen
times

Millfield
.
I
daresay
there
'll
be
a
shady
wood
,
and
trees
and
rocks
to
climb
.
And
other
children
to
play
with
.
Mr
and
Mrs
Barnet
have
three
children
.
"
"
Is
it
a
long
way
?
"
"
Twenty-three
miles
.
And
now
I
must
finish
packing
.
"
Not
that
her
packing
would
take
long
.
She
had
few
clothes
,
and
fewer
still
suitable
for
the
hot
weather
.
How
she
would
have
managed
had
not
Mrs
Carson
handed
down
two
dresses
,
both
of
fine
cotton
,
Ruth
did
n't
know
.
They
were
invaluable
.
When
she
had
packed
she
washed
Anna
's
hands
and
her
own
in
a
basin
of
cool
water
,
put
on
their
bonnets
,
and
took
Anna
's
hand
to
descend
the
stairs
.
As
they
reached
the
hall
Professor
Woodburn
came
in
from
the
street
.
His
face
was
flushed
and
damp
and
he
mopped
his
forehead
with
a
large
handkerchief
.
The
professor
was
Mrs
Gutermann
's
most
prestigious
boarder
,
and
her
favourite
.
She
cosseted
him
,
served
his
favourite
dishes
,
bullied
him
into
changing
his
clothes
when
he
came
in
drenched
from
one
of
New
York
's
torrential
showers
.
It
had
surprised
Ruth
that
the
Carsons
should
choose
to
live
in
a
boarding-house
,
until
she
discovered
that
in
New
York
it
was
quite
the
thing-always
supposing
that
the
establishment
was
high-class
and
in
a
good
locality
.
Spring
Street
,
just
off
Broadway
,
was
fashionable
,
and
no-one
could
describe
Mrs
Gutermann
's
as
other
than
high-class
.
Ruth
had
heard
her
boasting
to
the
Carsons
.
"
I
take
mostly
professional
people
,
"
she
'd
said
in
her
strong
voice
with
its
pronounced
German
accent
.
"
Professor
Woodburn

Mr
Gossop

the
New

Society

Fontwell
who

a
position
in
the
New
York
Historical
Society
,
and
so

.
All
my
boarders
are
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
"
She
did
not
mention
Mr
Pierce
.
He
was
a
manager
in
Brooke
Brothers
,
Men
's
Outfitters
-
and
being
in
trade
was
only
admissible
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
and
because
,
Mrs
Gutermann
being
a
widow
,
she
could
look
to
him
to
undertake
certain
practical
tasks
,
to
make
himself
useful
.
Anyway
,
he
was
a
manager
.
Had
he
been
an
ordinary
shop
assistant
it
would
not
have
done
at
all
.
"
Good
afternoon
,
Miss
Appleby
,
Anna
,
"
the
professor
said
.
"
How
cool
you
both
look
!
"
"
We
're
not
really
,
"
Ruth
replied
.
"
We
're
going
out
in
search
of
fresh
air
,
if
there
's
any

had
.
We
shall
go
to
your
Washington
Square

It
's
not
too
far
and
there
'll
be
shade
from

trees
.
"
She
called
it
his
Washington
Square
because
he
was
professor
of
English
in
the
university
there
.
According
to
Mr
Carson
,
the
professor
had
taken
his
degree
at
Oxford
,
but
he
had
been
in
America
for
several
years
now
.
"
There
is
a
little
shade
in
the
square
,
"
he
agreed
.
"
Though
it
is
not
cool
anywhere
.
Perhaps
one
day
when
you
are
in
that
direction
you
will
allow
me
to
show
you
my
department
in
the
university
.
"
"
That
would
be
most
pleasant
,
"
Ruth
said
.
The
professor
seemed
not
to
realise
that
she
was
a
servant
,
perhaps
because
she
was
so
much
with
the
Carsons
as
to
seem
almost
a
member
of
the
family
.
But
when
she
got
to
know
him
better
she
was
to
realise
that
he
treated
all
women
,
servants
or
otherwise
,
as
if
they
were
ladies
.
When
they
stepped
into
the
street
the
damp
warmth
hit
her
in
the
face
and
the
heat
of
the
pavements
struck
through
the
thin
soles
of
her
shoes
so
that
every
step
of
the
way
was
like
treading
on
hot
cinders
.
She
could
never
,
in
her
wildest
dreams
,
have
imagined
the
summer
weather
of
New
York
City
.
In
the
early
mornings
the
heat
came
in
through
her
open
bedroom
window
and
when
,
later
,
she
went
out
to
take
the
air
,
there
was
no
air
,
only
a
dense
,
clinging
humidity
.
She
walked
slowly
,
Anna
's
damp
hand
in
hers
,
keeping
to
what
shade
there
was
from
the
buildings
.
Sweat
beaded
her
face
and
soaked
her
body
in
the
most
unladylike
way
.
In
spite
of
having
sponged
herself
down
in
cold
water
to
close
the
pores
,
and
liberally
applied
powdered
chalk
to
absorb
the
perspiration
,
she
could
feel
the
rivulets
of
sweat
running
down
her
back
and
the
insides
of
her
thighs
.
"
If
we
walk
up
Broadway
we
'll
pass
Wagner
's
,
"
Anna
said
.
"
I
want
some
ice-cream
.
"
"
Then
want
must
be
your
master
,
"
Ruth
snapped
.
"
We
'll
just
stop
talking
about
it
if
you
please
!
"
She
was
ashamed
of
her
sharpness
,
but
the
heat
seemed
to
penetrate
her
brain
,
taking
over
her
senses
so
that
she
was
no
longer
in
control
.
She
felt
like
slapping
Anna
.
In
spite
of
what
Professor
Woodburn
had
said
,
it
was
a
little
cooler
in
Washington
Square
,
especially
as
they
were
lucky
enough
to
find
a
vacant
seat
under
a
tree
.
Ruth
had
discovered
Washington
Square
on
her
second
day
in
New
York
.
Its
air
of
peacefulness
was
in
such
contrast
to
Broadway
,
and
to
the
harbour
and
waterfront
on
the
day
they
had
landed
.
She
loved
these
contrasts
which
the
city
afforded
.
Whatever
one
's
mood
,
it
seemed
,
there
was
a
place
to
match
it
.
"
I
'm
bored
,
"
Anna
said
.
"
Ca
n't
we
play
a
game
?
"
"
It
's
far
too
hot
to
run
about
,
"
Ruth
told
her
.
"
You
may
pick
daisies
and
I
'll
show
you
how
to
make
a
daisy
chain
.
"
While
Anna
picked
flowers
,
Ruth
observed
every
detail
of
the
dress
and
deportment
of
the
people
in
the
square
,
for
she
hoped
one
day
to
emulate
them
.
She
did
not
dislike
her
present
job
,
but
she
had
no
intention
of
doing
such
work
forever
.
She
meant
to
get
on
in
the
world
.
She
had
no
idea
at
the
moment
what
she
would
(
or
could
)
do
,
but
she
knew
that
something
good
was
bound
to
happen
.
She
could
feel
it
in
her
bones
.
And
hopefully
it
would
happen
before
too
long
.
She
could
n't
wait
until
she
was
old
.
How
terrible
to
be
thirty
and
not
to
have
realised
one
's
ambitions
!
But
today
the
square
was
unusually
quiet
.
Anyone
who
could
do
so
had
already
left
the
city
for
the
comparative
cool
of
the
country
.
She
would
be
glad
when
they
themselves
followed
suit
.
"
We
must
return
home
,
"
she
told
Anna
when
they
had
made
the
daisy
chain
and
hung
it
around
the
little
girl
's
neck
.
"
But
since
you
've
been
so
good
,
you
shall
have
your
ice-cream
!
"
Broadway
was
as
crowded
as
ever
.
Clearly
there
were
many
people
who
could
n't
afford
to
escape
the
heat
of
the
city
.
Two
horse-drawn
buses
careered
down
the
middle
of
the
road
,
the
drivers
racing
against
each
other
,
scattering
everything
in
their
way
,
including
the
piles
of
rubbish
which
lay
stinking
in
the
heat
.
But
it
was
cooler
in
Wagner
's
and
the
ice-cream
was
deliciously
cold
to
the
tongue
and
delicately
flavoured
with
just
enough
vanilla
.
Ruth
had
never
tasted
ice-cream
before
coming
to
America
and
now
,
like
Anna
,
she
could
have
eaten
it
all
day
long
.
The
two
of
them
scraped
their
dishes
clean
.
When
they
emerged
it
was
hotter
than
ever
.
"
It
feels
like
a
storm
,
"
Ruth
said
.
"
We
'd
better
hurry

"
Mrs
Carson
was
already
back
.
She
lay
on
the
chaise
longue
,
fanning
herself
.
"

'm
quite
exhausted

she
exclaimed
.

nothing

Mrs

smiled
fondly
at

daughter

She
found
it
difficult
to
refuse
her
anything

said
quickly

was
adept
at
recognising
and
seizing
the
favourable
moment

Ruth
was
not
sure
what
difference
twenty-three
miles
would
make
to
the
climate
,
but
at
least
there
would
be
no
hard
pavements
or
buildings
to
reflect
the
heat

There
would
be
grass
underfoot

perhaps
a
lake

And
on
the
moor
at
home

she
thought
suddenly
,
there
will
be
a
breeze

the
heather

bloom

Soon
after
they
had
arrived
in
New
York
Anna
had
torn
a
dress
and
Mrs
Carson
had
handed
it
to
Ruth
to
repair
.
She
had
been
horrified
at
the
botch
Ruth
made
of
it
and
Ruth
had
begun
to
wish
that
she
had
taken
a
few
of
Hester
's
proffered
lessons
.
She
could
do
with
being
able
to
sew
for
her
own
sake
.
She
had
saved
enough
to
buy
a
length
of
material
in
the
market
,
but
by
the
time
she
had
enough
money
from
her
wages
to
pay
a
dressmaker
,
the
summer
would
be
over
.
Fortunately
,
Anna
's
dress
fitted
perfectly
.
Mrs
Carson
smiled
.
"
Spared
again

It
was
mid-morning
when
they
left
the
city

the
heat
was
already
building
up
again
.
"

"
Then

parasols

Mrs
Carson
decided
.
Ruth
wore
the
pale
lavender
cotton
dress
which
Mrs
Carson
had
given
her
.
It
fitted
closely
,
since
Mrs
Carson
was
thinner
than
her
servant
,
and
flatter-chested
.
She
had
pinned
a
bunch
of
violets
on
her
bonnet
and
put
new
,
light
grey
ribbons
on
it
.
She
was
aware
of
Mr

looking
at
her
,
and
when
he
handed
her
into
the
carriage
to
sit
beside
Ruth
she
felt
quite
the
lady
.
Or
almost
.
Elegant
kid
gloves
like
the
ones
Mrs
Carson
wore
would
have
improved
her
image
,
but
she
possessed
none
.
So
far
,
gloves
had
been
something
to
keep
out
the
raw
cold
of
the
Yorkshire
winter
.
Now
she
would
have
liked
them
to
have
covered
the
warmth
of
the
hand
which
Mr
Carson
took
lightly
in
his
.
For
his
part
he
noticed
,
not
the
dress
but
the
slender-waisted
,
full-breasted
figure
it
adorned
;
the
pretty
face
and
the
abundant
dark
hair
which
the
bonnet
framed
;
the
large
amber
eyes
which
met
his
as
he
helped
her
in
.
He
felt
the
warmth
of
the
hand
,
which
was
not
soft
to
the
touch
like
his
wife
's
,
but
firm
.
He
was
not
sure
whether
the
pulse
which
beat
in
their
joined
hands
was
hers
or
his
.
They
were
quickly
in
the
country
.
Above
Twenty-third
Street
the
buildings
began
to
thin
out
.
A
few
well-to-do
people
,
preferring
a
quiet
existence
,
had
built
houses
north
of
there
,
but
once
they
had
passed
those
and
were
driving
along
the
Bloomingdale
road
,
there
were
only
isolated
farmhouses
and
cottages
.
As
they
drove
north
the
landscape
became
more
rugged
,
with
hills
,
and
great
outcrops
of
rock
which
reminded
Ruth
of
home
,
though
the
Manhattan
hills
were
gentler
,
with
nothing
of
the
size
of
steepness
or
the
Yorkshire
fells
.
"
Thank
goodness
there
are
some
trees
,
"
Mr
Carson
remarked
.
"
The
shade
is
so
welcome
.
Anna
,
close
your
mouth
or
it
will
be
filled
with
dust
from
the
road
!
"
At
Manhattanville
they
stopped
to
water
the
horses
and
to
refresh
themselves
with
a
drink
of
lemonade
from
an
inn
.
The
lemonade
,
cold
as
ice
,
in
a
deep
earthenware
jug
with
slices
of
lemon
floating
on
top
,
was
delicious
.
"
And
now
we
must
be
on
our
way
again
,
"
Mr
Carson
said
.
Millfield
was
the
largest
house
Ruth
had
ever
seen
.
A
long
drive
curved
towards
a
three-storeyed
,
white
building
,
with
steps
leading
up
to
its
porticoed
door
and
on
either
side
of
the
doorway
a
wide
,
pillared
verandah
.
A
coal-black
manservant
came
out
to
the
carriage
and
showed
them
into
the
house
.
He
was
magnificently
tall
,
broad
,
and
handsome
,
and
Anna
stared
at
him
so
hard
that
she
tripped
,
and
fell
up
the
steps
.
She
was
not
yet
used
to
seeing
black-skinned
people
.
This
man
was
even
more
splendid
than
Sammy
,
the
page-boy
at
Gutermann
's
,
though
he
lacked
Sammy
's
braided
uniform
and
turban
.
He
seemed
kind
,
too
,
putting
out
a
hand
to
set
her
on
her
feet
again
.
Mrs
Barnet
,
accompanied
by
a
boy
of
about
Anna
's
age
,
was
in
the
spacious
hall
to
greet
them
.
"
Did
you
have
a
tolerable
journey
?
Was
it
very
hot
?
How
nice
to
meet
you
all
!
"
Mrs
Barnet
carried
too
much
flesh
on
her
small
frame
,
so
that
her
figure
appeared
several
years
older
than
her
face
.
Her
gown
looked
expensive
,
Ruth
thought
,
but
it
would
have
suited
her
mistress
better
than
it
did
its
owner
.
Also
it
was
too
elaborately
trimmed
for
the
country
.
She
had
pretty
fair
hair
which
escaped
from
its
disciplined
coiffure
in
tendrils
around
her
long
face
.
"
Mr
Barnet
has
an
errand
on
the
estate
,
"
the
lady
continued
.
"
And
George
and
Daisy
are
out
riding
.
Children
are
so
energetic
,
are
they
not
?
I
expect
your
little
Anna
is
the
same
!
And
here
is
Edward
,
who
has
so
been
looking
forward
to
a
new
playmate
!
"
She
gave
the
boy
a
push
and
he
and
Anna
faced
each
other
,
glowering
.
Ruth
felt
sure
that
but
for
the
presence
of
their
parents
they
would
have
stuck
out
their
tongues
.
"
We
had
a
pleasant
journey
,
thank
you
,
"
Mrs
Carson
said
.
"
Anna
,
say
hello
to
Edward
.
"
Ruth
was
glad
for
her
mistress
's
sake
that
Mrs
Barnet
seemed
so
friendly
.
Mrs
Carson
had
been
a
little
apprehensive
about
their
visit
.
Mr
Barnet
was
no
more
than
a
business
acquaintance
,
but
with
true
American
hospitality
he
had
taken
pity
on
the
young
English
couple
who
had
no
means
of
escaping
from
the
city
.
"
Now
Reuben
will
show
you
to
your
rooms
,
"
Mrs
Barnet
announced
.
Ruth
longed
to
go
with
Anna
to
their
room
.
She
wanted
to
wash
her
face
and
hands
in
cold
water
,
if
possible
to
lie
down
for
five
minutes
.
She
felt
quite
sick
and
dizzy
from
the
long
drive
over
the
bumpy
road
.
"
I
have
put
your
daughter
in
a
cot
in
your
room
,
"
Mrs
Barnet
continued
.
"
We
have
a
very
full
house
,
but
in
any
case
I
'm
sure
you
'll
want
her
with
you
.
Then
Reuben
will
take
your
maid
to
the
servants
"
quarters
.
"
So
the
fluttering
Mrs
Barnet
knows
where
I
belong
,
Ruth
thought
.
She
waited
alone
in
the
great
pillared
hall
until
Reuben
returned
.
From
the
slight
smile
he
gave
her
she
judged
him
friendly
,
but
dignified
;
conscious
of
his
position
in
the
household
.
"
Please
come
with
me
,
"
he
said
.
At
the
back
of
the
hall
a
flight
of
stairs
led
down
to
the
servants
'
kitchen
.
That
,
too
,
was
on
a
larger
scale
than
anything
she
had
ever
known
.
She
remembered
how
huge
she
had
thought
the
Longhills
'
kitchen
on
her
arrival
in
Nordale
,
and
reckoned
that
it
would
have
fitted
into
a
corner
of
this
one
.
There
were
at
least
eight
people
in
it
,
most
of
them
busy
.
Only
two
men
and
a
woman
,
who
sat
at
a
centre
table
,
were
not
at
work
,
though
the
woman
had
a
piece
of
sewing
in
her
hands
.
The
men
looked
up
as
Reuben
led
Ruth
towards
them
.
Ruth
knew
at
once
that
she
had
seen
one
of
the
men
before
.
While
he
regarded
her
with
evident
interest
,
she
searched
her
mind
.
Had
she
passed
him
on
the
street
-
on
Broadway
perhaps
?
But
why
should
she
have
remembered
him
?
He
had
a
pale
face
,
deep
blue
eyes
,
hair
darker
and
straighter
than
hers
,
and
a
mouth
which
curved
and
turned
up
at
the
corners
in
an
almost
feminine
way
.
A
pleasant
enough
appearance
,
but
in
no
way
memorable
.
"
Come
and
sit
yourself
down
,
"
he
invited
.
The
moment
she
heard
his
soft
Irish
voice
,
Ruth
remembered
.
He
was
the
man
on
the
Flamingo
,
the
one
who
had
explained
to
her
why
so
many
ships
lay
at
anchor
.
And
the
reason
why
she
had
been
so
slow
to
recognise
him
was
that
on
the
ship
he
had
looked
so
much
older
.
Now
the
years
had
fallen
away
from
him
.
His
face
had
filled
out
,
the
slight
hollows
beneath
his
cheekbones
owing
nothing
to
hunger
and
serving
only
to
accentuate
his
agreeable
features
;
the
slight
tilt
of
his
nose
,
the
long
,
Irish
upper
lip
,
the
blueness
of
his
eyes
.
Ruth
now
put
him
at
no
more
than
five-and-twenty
.
"
Sit
ye
down
,
"
he
repeated
.
He
poured
a
drink
and
pushed
it
towards
her
.
It
was
pale
green
,
with
a
delicious
new
taste
which
turned
out
to
be
that
of
limes
.
"
Ye
looked
startled
when
ye
saw
me
,
"
the
man
said
.
"
Not
startled

Ruth
contradicted
.
"
Puzzled

looked
surprised

face
intently

she
felt
embarrassed

Had
she
also
changed
in
a
few
short
months

indicated
the

thought
"

would
have
been
a
better
description

inclined
her
head
.
"
And
this

Mr
Herbert
Fraser
.
Their
master
and
mistress
are
visiting
here
.
"
Mr
Fraser
gave
Ruth
a
strong
handshake
,
his
round
,
apple-cheeked
face
creasing
in
a
smile
.
Then
as
she
was
about
to
explain
her
own
presence
there
,
the
outer
door
of
the
kitchen
opened
and
a
man
entered
.
He
was
tall
:
elegantly
dressed
for
riding
in
well-cut
white
breeches
and
a
black
jacket
which
fitted
to
perfection
over
his
broad
shoulders
and
deep
chest
.
He
was
dark-skinned
,
as
if
there
might
be
Mediterranean
blood
in
him
.
In
fact
Ruth
thought
,
his
features
were
very
like
those
of
a
man
in
the
reproduction
of
an
Italian
painting
which
had
hung
in
the
Longhills
"
drawing
room
.
He
had
a
straight
but
prominent
nose
,
a
well-shaped
generous
mouth
,
dark
eyebrows
which
almost
,
but
not
quite
,
met
over
the
bridge
of
his
nose
.
But
most
noticeable
of
all
-
it
was
something
apart
from
his
physical
appearance
-
he
had
a
presence
which
immediately
dominated
his
surroundings
.
It
would
be
easy
to
forget
everyone
else
when
he
was
there
.
The
Irishman
sprang
to
his
feet
.
"
See
to
Prince
,
"
the
newcomer
said
.
His
voice
was
deep
and
strong
,
matching
his
appearance
.
"

Ruth
could
not
take
her
eyes
off
him
.
Then
,
as
he
seemed
about
to
leave
,
he
shifted
his
gaze
from
Sean
O'Farrell
and
caught
her
staring
.
He
stared
back
and
,
blushing
with
confusion
,
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
gave
him
a
little
bob
.
"

do
n't
know

asked
.

did
so
she
could
not
look
away
.
"

he
said
.
Then
he
turned
,
and
left
the
room
.
Ruth
found
herself
obliged
to
share
a
bedroom
with
Polly
Beard
.
Miss
Beard
-
to
her
face
only
Sean
O'Farrell
dared
use
her
first
name

bringing
a
blush

her
cheeks

did
so

coarse
a

refined
creature

made
it
plain
that

room

she
assured
Ruth
.
"
Which
Mrs
Telscombe
has
furnished
especially
for
me
.
She
is
a
woman
of
refined
taste
and
comes
from
one
of
our
oldest
families
.
I
dare
say
you
are
not
used
to
servants
"
halls
either
.
"
Since
sharing
a
room
with
her
was
clearly
going
to
be
more
bearable
if
Miss
Beard
could
suppose
Ruth
to
be
a
cut
above
the
other
servants
,
Ruth
humoured
her
.
"
No
.
I
've
never
been
used
to
that
.
I
share
Anna
's
room
and
live
close
to
the
family
.
"
Miss
Beard
nodded
with
satisfaction
at
her
reflection
in
the
spotted
mirror
,
before
which
she
was
brushing
her
sparse
,
dun-coloured
hair
.
Then
she
put
down
the
hairbrush
and
inspected
her
countenance
.
Ruth
wondered
if
she
was
gazing
at
the
dark
whiskers
which
sprouted
on
her
chin
and
made
her
so
appropriately
,
though
unfortunately
,
named
.
"
Of
course
we
shall
not
be
staying
here
long
,
"
Miss
Beard
said
.
"
Were
it
not
that
Mr
Telscombe
had
business
to
discuss
with
Mr
Barnet
I
doubt
we
should
be
here
at
all
.
We
are
not
really
on
visiting
terms
.
Indeed
,
we
are
on
our
way
to
the
Astors
.
"
Even
Ruth
,
ignorant
as
she
was
of
New
York
society
,
knew
about
the
Astors
.
Who
did
n't
?
Now
she
pleased
Miss
Beard
by
opening
her
eyes
wide
and
looking
suitably
impressed
.
"
Tell
me
,
Miss
Beard
,
is
it
true
that
Mr
Astor
's
income
is
two
million
dollars
a
year
,
four
dollars
a
minute
?
I
ca
n't
believe
it
!
"
"
Oh
,
I
'm
sure
it
will
be
true
,
"
Miss
Beard
said
nonchalantly
.
"
Not
that
any
mistress
talks
much
about
money
.
I
know
in
New
York
it
is
wealth
that
counts
,
but
I
am
pleased
to
say
that
it
is
not
so
everywhere
.
In
Virginia
it
is
family
which
matters
,
and
the
Telscombes
are
a
very
old
family
.
At
home
there
we
move
in
the
highest
circles
.
"
"
As
the
Carsons
do
in
England
,
"
Ruth
replied
impulsively
.
She
doubted
if
it
was
anywhere
near
the
truth
,
but
clearly
it
made
Miss
Beard
happy
.
Ruth
resisted
a
fleeting
temptation
to
bring
in
Queen
Victoria
and
the
Royal
family
,
deciding
that
her
almost
total
ignorance
would
quickly
let
her
down
.
"
The
Barnets
are
nouveau
riche
,
"
Miss
Beard
confided
.
"
Their
wealth
has
secured
them
a
place
in
New
York
society
-
and
one
must
admit
that
Mr
Barnet
is
a
very
presentable
man
,
though
somewhat
offhand
.
But
it
is
different
in
Virginia
.
"
When
she
spoke
of
Virginia
it
was
in
reverent
tones
,
as
if
it
was
the
last
stage
on
the
journey
to
heaven
.
"
Is
Mr
Barnet
well
liked
?
"
Ruth
asked
lightly
.
"
Well
enough
,
"
Miss
Beard
conceded
.
"
My
mistress
likes
him
,
but
then
all
the
ladies
do
.
And
his
wife
is
pleasant
.
But
his
children
are
odious
,
as
you
will
find
out
.
"
Ruth
soon
came
to
share
Miss
Beard
's
opinion
of
the
Barnet
children
,
especially
of
Edward
,
but
Anna
was
attracted
to
him
and
within
twenty-four
hours
was
his
willing
slave
.
She
followed
him
everywhere
,
allowing
him
to
bully
and
browbeat
her
for
all
he
was
worth
just
as
long
as
he
did
n't
banish
her
.
Sometimes
it
was
Ruth
's
job
to
look
after
them
both
,
though
not
often
,
since
Edward
had
his
own
governess
,
Miss
Fitch
,
who
was
omnipresent
and
jealously
guarded
her
position
.
Ruth
hated
the
way
Anna
let
herself
be
dominated
by
this
selfish
boy
.
"
You
should
stand
up
for
yourself
,
Anna
,
"
she
told
her
.
"
Never
give
in
to
a
bully
.
"
He
had
taken
all
Anna
's
coloured
chalks
,
so
that
she
was
reduced
to
standing
and
watching
while
he
drew
the
pictures
.
"
I
want
Edward
to
have
my
chalks
,
"
Anna
said
flatly
.
"
I
like
watching
him
draw
.
He
does
it
better
than
I
do
.
"
Since
Ruth
was
required
to
be
less
and
less
with
the
children
she
found
herself
with
too
much
time
on
her
hands
,
and
since
she
was
unused
to
idleness
she
found
the
vacant
hours
trying
.
Mrs
Carson
noticed
Ruth
's
listlessness
and
rightly
interpreted
its
cause
.
"
You
could
help
me
more
,
"
she
suggested
.
"
You
could
help
me
dress
my
hair
,
manicure
my
nails
.
Most
of
the
ladies
here
have
their
own
maids
.
"
So
it
was
arranged
.
Ruth
never
felt
that
she
was
good
at
it
,
but
it
made
a
change
,
and
she
enjoyed
listening
to
her
mistress
's
accounts
of
her
days
.
She
thought
too
that
Mrs
Carson
liked
having
her
there
.
She
was
still
a
little
unsure
of
herself
in
American
society
.
"
I
hope
you
are
enjoying
yourself
,
Ruth
,
"
Mrs
Carson
said
one
evening
.
In
fact
,
Ruth
heartily
wished
herself
back
in
New
York
.
She
was
bored
at
Millfield
.
"
Yes
,
thank
you
,
ma'am
,
"
she
replied
dutifully
.
"
Though
I
have
n't
always
enough
to
do
.
It
would
be
pleasant
if
-
"
She
hesitated
.
"
Yes
?
"
"
Well
,
perhaps
you
might
allow
me
to
go
for
a
walk
from
time
to
time
,
instead
of
waiting
around
in
the
servants
"
hall
.
But
only
when
you
were
n't
likely
to
need
me
,
of
course
.
"
"
Very
well
,
Ruth
,
"
Mrs
Carson
agreed
.
"
But
see
to
it
that
you
do
n't
go
too
far
,
and
try
always
to
be
in
the
house
when
you
think
you
might
be
needed
.
"
Not
all
Ruth
's
time
with
the
other
servants
was
disagreeable
,
but
she
quickly
found
that
Millfield
's
own
staff
had
little
time
for
the
servants
of
visitors
,
especially
anyone
they
thought
might
consider
themselves
superior
.
In
this
,
in
spite
of
her
repeated
offers
to
help
Mrs
Cranbrook
,
the
cook
,
she
found
herself
classed
with
Polly
Beard
and
Herbert
Fraser
.
She
sensed
,
too
,
that
her
English
accent
kept
her
a
little
apart
,
made
her
sound
uppish
.
She
doubted
that
in
ordinary
circumstances
Herbert
Fraser
and
Polly
Beard
got
on
well
together
.
He
had
a
valet
's
professional
mistrust
of
all
lady
's
maids
.
Ruth
thought
he
was
also
disappointed
that
his
opposite
number
was
n't
young
and
attractive
.
But
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
they
presented
a
united
front
.
Sean
O'Farrell
was
no-one
's
enemy
.
He
was
friendly
to
everyone
.
"
They
're
all
all
right
really
,
"
he
told
Ruth
.
She
had
been
irritated
by
the
cook
's
refusal
of
her
offer
to
make
a
simple
white
sauce
,
though
Mrs
Cranbrook
was
up
to
her
eyes
in
work
.
"
Remember
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
we
're
all
the
same
kind
.
We
should
band
together
.
"
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
Ruth
asked
.
"
That
's
our
strength
,
"
he
said
.
"
Sticking
together
.
"
Though
she
had
certainly
never
thought
herself
superior
to
her
fellow
servants
,
Ruth
had
no
wish
to
be
too
close
.
She
knew
already
that
to
think
like
a
servant
was
the
surest
way
to
remain
one
-
something
she
was
determined
not
to
do
.
Sean
was
always
busy
.
Members
of
the
house-party
were
constantly
taking
trips
;
calling
on
neighbours
,
going
on
picnics
,
inspecting
local
beauty
spots
.
He
was
forever
in
demand
,
in
spite
of
which
he
remained
affable
and
good-tempered
.
Ruth
was
in
the
servants
'
hall
one
day
when
he
returned
from
yet
another
picnic
.
"
Did
you
have
a
good
time

she
asked
him

"

His
blue
eyes
invited
her
to
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
(
which
she
did
,

found
the
thought
quite
pleasing

good
thing

do
n't
take
you

told
him
.
"
I
might
be
annoyed

"
"
Oh

but
I

he
assured
her
.
"

not
stupid

Ruth
.
"
She
had
sensed
from
the
beginning
that
his
compliments
to
her
were
of
a
different
kind
from
those
he
bestowed
so
liberally
upon
every
female
in
sight
,
but
she
could
n't
tell
him
that
,
while
in
her
heart
she
liked
them
,
she
might
be
annoyed
by
his
assumption
that
they
were
always
acceptable
.
"
Yorkshiremen
do
n't
go
in
for
paying
compliments
,
"
she
said
.
"
they
think
it
's
a
bit
soft

So
their
womenfolk
don
t
always
know
how
to
accept
them
.
"
"
Which
is
a
pity

Sean
stated
.
"
Compliments

wheels
of
life

Even
a
bit
of
flattery

"
She
knew
that
Sean
found
her
attractive
.
She
would
have
liked
to
have
made
the
truth
plain
-
that
the
feeling
,
though
not
one
to
be
taken
too
seriously
,
was
mutual
.
But
that
was
too
big
a
step
for
convention
to
allow
.
Convention
demanded
that
a
woman
must
skirt
around
the
truth
,
fobbing
off
a
man
while
leading
him
on

To
be

direct

to

unfeminine

Anna
was
immersed
in
a
game
with
Edward
under
the
watchful
eye
of
Miss
Fitch
,
who
gave
Ruth
no
welcome
:
so
she
decided
to
go
for
a
walk
.
She
knew
better
than
to
walk
around
the
front
of
the
house
.
Servants
,
except
when
summoned
,
must
never
be
visible
.
It
would
not
do
for
some
occupant
of
the
house
to
look
out
of
the
window
and
actually
see
one
walking
across
the
lawn
.
She
took
a
path
across
the
land
at
the
side
of
the
house
and
found
that
it
led
to
a
small
wood
which
girdled
the
top
of
the
hill
on
which
the
house
was
built
.
Having
walked
through
the
wood
,
she
emerged
on
to
a
small
,
high
plateau
,
from
which
a
wide
sweep
of
the
countryside
below
was
visible
.
One
could
sit
here
and
admire
the
view
,
she
thought
;
or
lie
almost
hidden
by
the
tall
golden
grasses
which

perhaps
because
the
place
was
not
easy
of
access
,
had
been
left
to
grow
to
their
full
height
and
now
filled
the
air
with
their
mingled
scents
.
Ruth
chose
a
place
and
sat
down
.
There
had
been
a
shower
earlier
in
the
day
,
and
although
the
hot
sun
had
dried
the
ground
again
,
a
sharper-than-usual
smell
of
earth
and
growing
things
still
lingered
.
She
lay
back
on
the
ground
and
inhaled
deeply
.
When
she
closed
her
eyes
,
the
sun
warm
on
her
face
,
she
recognised
the
perfume
of
the
grasses
as
ones
she
had
encountered
before
.
And
then
she
remembered
Dick
;
the
journey
back
from
Skipton
,
and
her
first
and
only
taste
of
lovemaking
,
there
in
the
field
.
It
was
almost
two
years
since
then
,
but
the
scents
in
her
nostrils
were
so
evocative
that
every
detail
of
that
occasion
came
sharply
into
her
mind
.
She
could
remember
the
feel
of
Dick
's
hands
on
her
body
,
his
voice
in
her
ear
.
She
did
not
think
at
all
of
the
consequences
,
only
of
the
act
itself
.
And
remembering
it
-
it
seemed
more
as
if
she
relived
it
-
her
whole
body
ached
,
tensed
,
fidgeted
.
She
held
her
arms
across
her
aching
breasts
so
tightly
that
her
fingers
dug
into
her
flesh
,
but
whether
in
an
effort
to
contain
herself
or
as
a
substitute
for
someone
else
's
embrace
,
she
did
n't
know
.
Nor
did
she
know
whose
embrace
she
was
seeking
.
It
did
n't
matter
.
She
was
not
sure
how
long
she
had
been
there
,
or
how
long
she
might
have
remained
,
had
she
not
been
disturbed
.
It
was
the
thud
of
a
horse
's
hooves
,
very
near
,
almost
on
her
,
which
jerked
her
back
to
reality
.
She
jumped
to
her
feet
,
screaming
in
terror
,
certain
that
she
was
about
to
be
trampled
on
.
At
the
sound
of
her
scream
the
horse
stopped
short
,
reared
,
whinnied
loudly
in
distress
and
fright
at
the
figure
which
appeared
suddenly
,
noisily
,
from
the
long
grass
just
beyond
its
forelegs
.
While
the
rider
tried
to
hold
on
,
to
calm
the
horse
and
to
prevent
himself
being
thrown
,
Ruth
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
towards
the
wood
.
"
STOP
!
"
It
was
a
voice
not
to
be
disobeyed
:
authoritative
,
commanding
.
She
stopped
at
once
.
"
Come
here
!
"
Reluctantly
she
turned
around
-
and
saw
that
the
rider
was
Mr
Barnet
;
also
that
he
was
exceedingly
angry
,
his
eyebrows
meeting
in
a
fierce
scowl
,
his
dark
eyes
blazing
.
"
Come
here
at
once
,
I
say
!
"
The
horse
was
a
big
one
,
a
grey
of
about
seventeen
hands
.
Though
it
was
quieter
now
,
Ruth
walked
forward
with
trepidation
,
stopping
a
few
yards
short
of
it
.
Horse
and
rider
towered
above
her
.
"
Do
n't
you
ever
do
that
again
!
Never
,
ever
,
do
you
hear

"
There
was
an
ice-cold
anger
in
Joss
Barnet
's
voice
which
lashed
Ruth
as
if
he
had
used
the
whip
in
his
hand
.
"

valuable
horse

Ruth
's
fury
suddenly
equalled
his
.
"
I
"
m
aware
that
he
could
have
harmed
me

"
she
retorted
.
"
I
move
quickly
so
that
I
should
n't
be
trampled
to
death
.
Am
I
supposed
to
lie
down
and
be
killed
,
then
,
so
that
your

n't

frightened
?
"
The
words
rushed
out
.
She
did
n't
care
what
she
said
,
or
that
he
was
who
he
was
.
But
when
she
came
to
the
end
of
them
,
and
stood
there
trembling
,
she
realised
that
if
he
remembered
her
he
would
certainly
report
her
to
Mr
Carson
.
Such
insolence
-
that
was
what
it
would
be
called
-
could
cost
her
her
job
.
There
was
nothing
else
for
it
,
she
would
have
to
apologise
.
But
why
should
she
?
He
had
not
shown
the
slightest
concern
for
her
.
She
might
be
hurt
,
but
he
did
n't
care
.
He
had
n't
so
much
as
asked
.
She
looked
up
at
him
,
well
aware
that
her
rebellious
thoughts
must
show
in
her
expression
.
To
her
surprise
,
the
anger
left
his
face
.
There
was
a
twist
to
his
mouth
which
,
though
not
going
so
far
as
to
be
a
smile
,
showed
some
amusement
.
"
I
know
who
you
are
,
"
he
said
.
His
voice
was
still
stern
.
"
You
are
the
young
lady
who
belongs
to
Mr
Carson
.
"
Ruth
's
faint
hope
that
he
would
not
remember
her
died
.
But
she
was
emphatically
not
sorry
for
anything
she
'd
said
,
and
she
decided
that
nothing
in
the
world
would
make
her
say
she
was
.
"
I
would
n't
have
frightened
your
horse
deliberately
,
"
she
replied
.
"
I
should
hope
not
.
That
would
be
both
stupid
and
dangerous
.
At
any
rate
you
seem
to
have
come
to
no
harm
.
"
"
I
did
n't
know

"
Who

he
asked
.
"
Servants

.
"
She
was
aware
there
was
nothing
of
the
servant
in
her
voice
.
Now
he
did
smile
,
and
it
changed
him
completely
,
lifting
the
lines
of
his
face
so
that
he
appeared
hardly
older
than
herself
,
though
she
knew
from
Miss
Beard
that
he
was
almost
thirty
.
"
I
ca
n't
see

he
said
.
"

"

He
continued
to
look
at
her
and
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
off
him
.
"
But

I
chose
to
do
so
,
what
then
,
Miss
Ruth
Appleby

"
She
was
astonished
,
and
secretly
pleased
,
that
he
had
remembered
her
name
.
"
Since
you
have
given
your
permission

she
said
slowly
,
"
why
then

I
would
come
here
just
the
same

"
He
nodded
,
then
turned
and
rode
away
at
a
canter
.
Ruth
dawdled
back
through
the
wood
,
reluctant
to
return
.
The
moment
she
set
foot
in
the
house
,
Cook
called
out
to
her
.
"
You

Your

minutes

"
Where
on
earth
have
you
been

Mrs
Carson
asked
crossly
when
Ruth
appeared
.
"
I
'm
sorry
,
ma'am
.
I
was
out
walking

"

taking
walks

"
Ruth
thought
Mrs
Carson
had
been
put
out
by
something
other
than
her
small
misdemeanour
.
At
a
guess
,
she
had
had
a
tiff
with
Mr
Carson
.
But
it
behoved
her
to
tread
warily
if
she
did
n't
wish
to
find
her
new-found
freedom
curtailed
and
that
was
the
last
thing
she
wanted
.
"
I
'm
really
very
sorry
,
ma'am
,

she
repeated
.
"
I
promise

n't
happen
again

"
"
Well
,

that

does
n't

Mrs
Carson
replied
.
"
It
pleases
me
to
give
you
privileges

I
do
n't
care

abused

Now
,
what
shall
I
wear
this
evening

I
think
the
grey
silk
might
be
suitable

"
When
Ruth
had
brushed
and
pinned
up
her
mistress
's
red-brown
hair
,
which
always
shone
as
though
newly
burnished
,
she
thought
how
lovely
Mrs
Carson
looked
.
She
had
a
skin
of
a
creamy
paleness
which
Ruth
envied
.
Her
own
rosy
cheeks
were
so
countrified
.
And
now
that
Mrs
Carson
's
awkward
mood
had
passed
,
her
brown
eyes
were
clear
and
soft
again

Mrs
Carson
said

looking
in

mirror

that
will
do
nicely

pleasantly
.

Mrs
Carson
gave

questioning
look

"
Well

true

some

superiority

own

had
never
forgotten
them
.
Sean
caught
Ruth
's
eye
and
winked
at
her
.
"
Well
then
,
Miss
Polly
,
if
I
'm
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
company
on
an
outing
it
will
have
to
be
soon
.
And
is
n't
it
the
luck
of
the
devil
that
the
master
do
n't
require
me
tomorrow
afternoon
?
Now
if
you
two
charming
ladies
,
and
Herbert
here
,
can
persuade
your
betters
to
free
you
from
the
chains
for
an
hour
or
two
,
we
're
as
good
as
on
our
way
!
"
So
it
was
arranged
.
Ruth
looked
forward
to
it
and
she
thought
that
,
secretly
,
Miss
Beard
did
also
.
When
Ruth
went
into
the
attic
that
night
she
caught
Miss
Beard
standing
in
front
of
the
mirror
,
holding
a
navy
muslin
dress
with
a
cream
lace
collar
against
herself
.
Flustered
by
Ruth
's
appearance
,
she
tried
to
hide
the
dress
,
but
she
was
too
late
.
"
It
really
becomes
you
,
"
Ruth
said
.
"
Shall
you
wear
it
for
the
picnic
?
"
"
I
doubt
it
,
"
Miss
Beard
replied
.
"
A
lady
never
dresses
too
finely
for
the
occasion
.
"
Ruth
awakened
early
next
morning
.
While
Miss
Beard
slept
on
she
rose
quietly
,
dressed
,
and
went
out
.
There
was
no-one
about
as
she
left
the
house
and
walked
towards
the
wood
.
This
hour
,
before
the
heat
began
to
build
up
,
was
the
best
time
of
day
to
be
out
of
doors
,
and
since
her
mistress
would
be
asleep
for
some
time
yet
she
was
free
to
go
as
she
pleased
.
There
was
an
unusual
excitement
in
her
this
morning
,
though
even
to
herself
she
did
not
admit
the
reason
.
In
the
deep
shade
of
the
trees-great
oaks
,
spreading
beeches
,
sycamores
,
which
had
been
there
longer
than
Millfield
House
-
the
air
was
almost
too
cool
,
and
underfoot
there
was
a
damp
,
springing
feeling
to
the
ground
.
But
where
the
wood
ended
she
stepped
into
another
world
.
The
ground
which
nurtured
the
long
golden
grass
was
hard
and
dry
.
Already
,
so
early
in
the
morning
,
the
sun
shone
brightly
.
She
walked
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
plateau
.
From
where
she
stood
the
downward
slope
and
the
valley
below
were
clearly
visible
.
The
countryside
here
was
so
different
from
her
native
dales
and
moors
.
It
was
richer
,
yet
less
splendid
.
More
fertile
,
so
that
man
would
be
able
to
tame
it
as
he
had
never
,
in
thousands
of
years
,
been
able
to
tame
her
wild
moors
.
Would
Mr
Barnet
ride
this
way
,
or
would
he
still
be
in
bed
?
She
knew
in
her
heart
that
that
was
why
she
was
here
.
The
thought
had
been
inside
her
ever
since
he
had
spoken
,
though
she
had
continually
pushed
it
away
.
But
now
,
since
no-one
else
inhabited
this
early
world
of
hers
,
she
would
allow
it
to
remain
.
But
was
her
imagination
too
hard
to
work
?
Had
she
read
something
into
his
words
which
was
not
really
there
?
Had
her
feelings
and
longings
as
she
had
lain
in
the
grass
,
remembering
Dick
and
their
lovemaking
,
her
body
crying
out
for
a
repetition
of
the
act
,
forged
a
false
link
in
her
mind
?
She
thought
not
.
She
remembered
the
way
Joss
Barnet
had
looked
at
her
.
She
knew
she
was
not
mistaken
about
that
.
She
continued
to
stand
at
the
edge
of
the
plateau
.
No
horse
and
rider
should
take
her
by
surprise
today
,
nor
easily
overlook
her
.
Her
sharp
eyes
scanned
the
countryside
below
and
,
in
spite
of
the
sun
,
she
felt
a
shiver
,
though
not
unpleasant
,
of
apprehension
.
She
did
not
have
long
to
wait
.
Within
a
few
minutes
she
saw
him
riding
towards
her
up
the
hill
,
his
horse
's
harness
glinting
in
the
sun
.
When
she
was
quite
sure
he
must
have
seen
her
she
sat
down
.
He
breasted
the
hill
,
riding
straight
for
her
,
coming
so
close
on
the
great
horse
that
Ruth
had
to
steel
herself
not
to
move
from
the
spot
.
She
looked
up
at
him
and
he
acknowledged
her
presence
by
a
brief
glance
,
but
without
slackening
speed
he
rode
past
her
,
towards
the
wood
.
Ruth
could
hardly
believe
it
.
She
had
been
so
sure
of
his
intentions
.
And
then
she
realised
that
the
hoof
beats
of
his
horse
had
come
to
an
abrupt
stop
.
She
turned
her
head
,
saw
him
tether
his
horse
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
,
watched
him
as
he
walked
towards
her
.
She
noticed
his
long
,
powerful
legs
,
the
immaculate
cut
of
his
close-fitting
breeches
,
his
purposeful
stride
.
As
he
drew
near
she
made
a
half-hearted
move
to
rise
.
She
did
not
count
this
as
a
master
and
servant
situation
,
yet
she
did
n't
dare
to
presume
too
far
.
She
looked
to
him
for
a
lead
and
he
gave
it
to
her
.
"
Stay
where
you
are
,
"
he
said
.
"
You
look
comfortable
there
.
"
He
stared
down
at
her
,
studying
her
in
every
detail
with
no
pretence
that
he
was
doing
otherwise
.
He
saw
a
young
woman
,
slight
of
figure
,
with
narrow
,
sloping
shoulders
and
a
waist
his
two
hands
could
easily
have
spanned
,
yet
full-bosomed
,
the
outline
of
her
breasts
,
the
small
mounds
of
her
nipples
,
thrusting
against
the
sprigged
cotton
dress
which
was
slightly
too
tight
for
her
.
The
neckline
was
low
and
the
upper
part
of
her
breasts
swelled
against
it
,
dividing
to
reveal
the
shadowy
cleft
between
them
.
Her
neck
rose
in
a
long
,
rounded
column
to
a
face
which
,
though
not
classically
beautiful
-
the
nose
was
too
tilted
,
the
mouth
too
wide
-
was
heart-stopping
in
its
freshness
,
its
air
of
innocence
combined
with
its
look
of
deep
,
untapped
feminine
knowledge
.
Was
she
aware
of
the
effect
her
large
,
amber-coloured
eyes
,
her
curving
red
lips
,
might
have
on
a
man
?
He
could
n't
tell
.
There
was
something
about
her
which
baffled
and
intrigued
him
.
"
The
grass
is
warm
already
,
"
Ruth
said
.
His
face
broke
into
a
smile
.
She
knew
what
she
was
about
all
right
.
"
You
tempt
me
to
try
it
,
"
he
replied
and
dropped
down
beside
her
.
"
I
"
m
sorry
,
"
she
floundered
.
"
I
did
n't
mean
-
"
"
Do
n't
be
coy
,
"
he
said
.
"
It
does
n't
suit
you
.
"
His
voice
was
sharp
,
yet
as
intimate
as
if
he
had
known
her
for
a
long
time
.
There
was
to
be
no
paddling
around
in
the
shallow
waters
for
this
man
,
Ruth
thought
.
And
with
the
thought
came
a
tiny
prick
of
fear
.
"
I
'm
not
being
coy
,
"
she
protested
.
"
I
was
trying
to
be
polite
.
I
'm
not
very
good
at
polite
conversation
.
"
He
did
n't
answer
.
For
several
seconds
they
just
sat
there
.
Ruth
wished
he
would
say
something
-
anything
.
She
found
the
silence
unbearable
.
In
the
end
she
said
the
very
last
thing
she
intended
.
"
I
must
go
!
"
"
Why
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Mrs
Carson
might
need
me
.
"
"
Your
mistress
will
be
asleep
,
as
you
well
know
.
"
Then
he
leaned
towards
her
and
took
both
her
hands
in
his
and
began
to
study
them
as
if
they
were
entirely
new
creations
,
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
seen
before
.
He
contemplated
the
palms
as
if
he
might
be
seeing
past
and
future
in
them
,
and
then
he
turned
her
hands
over
and
examined
the
backs
.
Though
tremors
ran
through
her
body
at
his
touch
,
she
wanted
to
draw
away
.
She
had
always
hated
her
hands
.
She
was
ashamed
that
they
were
large
,
and
neither
smooth
nor
white
,
but
hard
to
the
touch
,
and
calloused
,
with
the
knuckles
already
swollen
.
Servant
's
hands
,
which
nothing
could
disguise
.
She
would
have
preferred
him
to
concentrate
on
her
face
,
which
was
more
presentable
.
"
And
supposing
I
need
you
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Supposing
I
say
I
want
to
look
at
you
,
to
hear
you
talk
in
your
funny
English
voice
?
What
if
I
tell
you
you
've
not
been
out
of
my
mind
since
last
evening
?
"
"
Why
,
I
'd
not
believe
you
,
"
Ruth
said
.
"
And
you
should
n't
talk
to
me
so
.
It
's
not
fitting
.
"
He
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
loudly
.
"
Do
n't
tell
me
you
worry
about
what
's
fitting
!
I
do
n't
believe
that
!
"
His
eyes
,
which
were
darker
than
Ruth
remembered
,
almost
black
,
sparkled
with
amusement
.
"
You
have
a
low
opinion
of
me
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
you
think
I
do
n't
care
what
's
right
.
"
"
I
did
n't
say
that
.
I
said
you
would
n't
worry
about
what
was
fitting
.
A
question
only
of
manners
.
"
She
flared
at
him
.
He
was
trying
to
put
her
in
the
wrong
again
.
"
So
now
you
're
saying
I
'm
ill-mannered
?
"
"
Ah
!
I
've
made
you
angry
,
"
he
said
.
"
Good
!
You
're
exciting
when
you
're
angry
.
I
thought
so
yesterday
evening
.
"
"
Well
,
are
you
saying
I
'm
ill-mannered
?
"
Ruth
persisted
.
"
I
'm
saying
that
I
think
you
do
n't
care
about
the
stupidities
of
convention
.
That
you
're
honest
with
yourself
and
do
n't
dissemble
.
Otherwise
you
would
n't
be
here

You
knew
I
'd
come
,
did
n't
you
?
"
"
I
thought
you
might
,
"
she
admitted
reluctantly
.
How
could
he
make
her
confess
such
a
thing
?
It
was
brazen
of
her
.
"
You
hoped
I
might
.
You
wanted
me
to
.
If
not
,
you
could
easily
have
avoided
this
place
.
"
She
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
.
"
Let's
be
honest
with
each
other
,
"
he
said
.
"
Let's
have
no
more
talk
of
what
's
fitting
.
And
now
I
think
you
must
go
.
I
do
n't
want
you
to
be
in
trouble
with
your
mistress
.
"
It
was
agony
to
him
to
dismiss
her
.
She
had
aroused
him
so
much
that
he
wanted
to
take
her
here
and
now
,
on
the
ground
.
But
there
was
something
about
her
which
forbade
the
crudity
.
Ruth
jumped
to
her
feet
,
bitterly
disappointed
that
he
dismissed
her
so
suddenly
,
but
determined
not
to
show
it
.
He
stood
up
and
walked
beside
her
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
where
his
horse
was
tethered
.
Then
,
before
mounting
,
he
took
her
chin
between
his
finger
and
thumb
and
tilted
her
face
towards
his
,
kissing
her
lightly
on
the
cheek
.
"
Where
is
your
room
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Where
in
the
house
do
you
sleep
?
"
"
I
shared
a
room
with
Mrs
Telscombe
's
maid
.
"
She
was
trembling
now
from
head
to
foot
.
He
nodded
,
and
started
to
ride
away
.
When
he
was
almost
out
of
sight
she
called
after
him
.
"
They
leave
tomorrow
!
"
He
did
n't
look
back
.
There
was
no
telling
whether
he
had
heard
.
Back
at
the
house
the
kitchen
was
a
buzz
of
activity
.
Cook
was
making
fresh
cornbread
rolls
for
breakfast
and
lesser
mortals
were
hard
at
it
with
brooms
and
mops
.
Ruth
walked
through
the
kitchen
and
ascended
the
back
stairs
,
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
,
afraid
that
her
face
might
give
her
away
.
She
wanted
,
desperately
,
to
be
alone
.
She
wanted
to
think
about
what
had
happened
,
what
might
happen
.
But
solitude
was
impossible
.
Miss
Beard
was
there
,
easing
the
tightly-knotted
rag
curlers
out
of
her
hair
.
Ruth
took
off
her
dress
,
hastily
moving
a
stem
of
grass
which
fell
to
the
floor
,
poured
water
from
the
ewer
into
the
basin
,
and
set
about
washing
herself
.
She
splashed
herself
liberally
,
trying
to
reduce
the
flush
which
she
could
still
feel
on
her
cheeks
.
"
Well
,
"
Miss
Beard
said
,
"
we
have
a
fine
day
for
it
!
Just
as
long
as
the
heat
does
n't
build
up
into
a
storm
.
"
"
A
fine
day
?
"
"
For
the
outing
!
Mrs
Telscombe
has
kindly
said
that
I
may
be
free
from
two
o'clock
until
six
.
I
hope
your
mistress
will
accord
you
the
same
privilege
.
"
Ruth
had
totally
forgotten
the
outing
and
her
immediate
feeling
was
that
she
did
n't
want
to
go
.
She
wished
to
be
quiet
.
She
felt
,
deep
inside
her
,
that
there
would
be
decisions
to
make
.
Or
should
she
simply
let
things
take
their
course
,
give
herself
up
to
the
almost
overwhelming
attraction
Joss
Barnet
had
for
her
?
But
to
do
that
was
in
itself
to
make
a
decision
.
It
was
clear
that
he
was
attracted
to
her
.
She
was
sure
he
would
seek
her
out
again
.
The
thought
of
Mrs
Barnet
entered
her
head
only
fleetingly
,
to
be
as
quickly
dismissed
.
It
was
inconceivable
that
she
could
take
from
Mrs
Barnet
anything
that
was
rightly
hers
,
nor
did
Ruth
flatter
herself
that
Joss
Barnet
's
interest
in
her
was
anything
but
transient
.
It
was
too
much
to
expect
,
not
the
way
of
the
world
.
So
Sean
O'Farrell
and
his
pleasantries
would
not
be
to
her
taste
today
.
He
was
perceptive
.
He
would
sense
that
she
was
not
herself
.
And
she
knew
that
this
outing
had
been
contrived
by
him
so
that
he
could
make
progress
with
her
.
She
did
like
him
.
She
liked
him
very
much
.
Had
Joss
Barnet
not
joined
her
this
morning
she
might
have
felt
quite
differently
about
the
plan
.
All
these
thoughts
raced
through
Ruth
's
head
while
Miss
Beard
continued
to
babble
.
She
heard
the
lady
's
voice
but
she
had
no
idea
what
she
was
saying
until
a
sharpness
in
Miss
Beard
's
tone
signified
that
she
was
repeating
the
same
remark
.
"
I
'm
sorry
?
"
Ruth
queried
.
"
Perhaps
you
should
take
some
soap
and
water
to
your
ears
,
"
Miss
Beard
said
acidly
.
"
I
said
,
what
shall
you
wear
?
"
"
I
'm
sorry
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
-
"
Ruth
hesitated
.
"
-
I
'm
not
sure
that
I
can
go
.
"
"
Not
go
?
Not
go
?
Why
ever
not
?
"
'I
-
I
do
n't
feel
well
.
I
think
perhaps
I
have
a
chill
.
"
"
But
if
you
do
n't
go
then
I
ca
n't
go
!
"
Miss
Beard
cried
.
"
Could
you
not
take
a
powder
?
Or
perhaps
you
will
feel
better
by
two
o'clock
?
"
Ruth
had
never
seen
anyone
look
so
disappointed
.
The
older
woman
's
face
puckered
and
for
a
moment
Ruth
thought
she
might
cry
-
which
was
unthinkable
in
Miss
Beard
.
It
dawned
upon
Ruth
with
some
surprise
that
the
outing
was
to
be
a
great
treat
for
Miss
Beard
,
and
that
in
spite
of
all
her
high-faluting
talk
,
not
many
of
those
came
her
way
.
Ruth
knew
she
could
no
more
disappoint
her
than
she
could
snatch
a
toy
from
a
baby
.
"
Well
,
I
daresay
you
're
right
,
"
she
agreed
.
"
I
'll
ask
Cook
to
give
you
some
cinnamon
water
,
"
Miss
Beard
declared
.
"
That
should
do
the
trick
!
"
"
Thank
you
,
"
Ruth
said
.
"
I
'm
sure
it
will
.
"
Since
she
hated
cinnamon
water
next
only
to
cod-liver
oil
it
would
be
a
suitable
penance
for
having
given
Miss
Beard
a
nasty
moment
.
When
Ruth
and
Miss
Beard
arrived
at
the
rear
door
of
the
house
,
the
carriage
was
already
waiting
.
Ruth
thought
how
smart
Sean
looked
.
He
had
discarded
his
uniform
and
wore
his
best
suit
,
a
light
pearly
grey
,
with
a
brightly-coloured
necktie
,
and
a
rose
in
his
buttonhole
.
His
grey
hat
,
which
he
swept
off
with
a
flourish
as
the
ladies
approached
,
was
set
at
a
jaunty
angle
.
Mr
Fraser
was
,
as
usual
,
dark-suited
,
but
as
a
concession
to
the
occasion
he
also
sported
a
rose
in
his
lapel
.
Miss
Beard
,
in
the
navy
muslin
with
the
cream
lace
collar
which
yesterday
she
had
affected
to
consider
too
fine
for
the
event
,
carried
a
cream
parasol
.
Ruth
wore
Mrs
Carson
's
lavender
cast-off
with
her
one
and
only
bonnet
,
and
was
therefore
all
the
more
pleased
by
Sean
's
appreciative
look
as
his
glance
took
in
her
appearance
from
top
to
toe
.
"
'T
IS
a
beautiful
sight
the
pair
of
ye
are
!
"
he
said
.
Ruth
knew
,
as
his
eyes
met
hers
,
that
the
words
were
meant
for
her
.
For
all
the
world
as
if
she
and
Miss
Beard
were
ladies
of
quality
,
he
ceremoniously
handed
them
into
the
carriage
,
the
two
of
them
to
sit
together
in
the
back
,
while
Herbert
Fraser
sat
beside
Sean
in
the
front
.
Ruth
guessed
that
the
seating
arrangements
were
for
the
benefit
of
whoever
might
be
watching
their
departure
,
and
that
they
would
not
prevail
.
"
Where
are
we
bound
for
?
"
she
asked
.
Not
that
she
cared
.
She
was
here
in
the
flesh
to
oblige
Miss
Beard
,
but
her
mind
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
Joss
Barnet
.
Even
Sean
's
obvious
appreciation
of
her
had
served
mainly
to
boost
her
confidence
as
to
how
she
would
look
in
that
other
man
's
eyes
,
if
by
some
absolute
miracle
they
should
meet
him
for
a
moment
as
they
were
driving
through
the
grounds
of
Millfield
House
.
All
she
really
wanted
,
if
she
could
not
be
in
his
presence
,
was
to
be
left
alone
so
that
she
could
recall
and
relive
in
her
mind
every
moment
of
that
morning
's
encounter
,
and
dream
about
what
the
future
might
hold
for
her
.
He
had
said
she
did
n't
care
about
the
stupidities
of
convention
.
Was
he
right
?
Sean
gathered
up
the
reins
and
drove
off
at
a
smart
pace
.
"
Just
you
wait
and
see
!
"
he
said
.
It
took
Ruth
a
second
or
two
to
realise
that
he
was
replying
to
her
question
,
not
to
the
thoughts
which
whirled
around
in
her
head
.
"
Twill
be
a
pleasant
surprise
,
I
promise
you
,
"
he
declared
.
"
I
'm
sure
it
will
,
"
Ruth
agreed
.
"
I
like
the
countryside
around
here
-
what
I
've
seen
of
it
.
Do
n't
you
,
Miss
Beard
?
"
"
It
's
quite
pleasant
,
"
her
companion
conceded
.
"
Though
after
Virginia
-
Now
if
you
were
to
take
a
drive
around
Williamsburg
-
"
"
I
hope
I
may
,
one
day
,
"
Ruth
said
.
There
was
silence
for
a
while
.
When
she
was
not
holding
forth
on
the
almighty
Telscombes
,
or
the
glories
of
Virginia
,
Miss
Beard
had
little
to
say
;
and
Ruth
was
in
no
mood
to
talk
.
In
fact
,
she
noticed
little
of
the
countryside
through
which
they
passed
.
The
harvest
had
been
gathered
and
she
was
vaguely
conscious
of
the
glint
of
the
sun
on
the
gold
and
brown
stubble
.
Where
,
in
one
place
the
track
was
lined
with
trees
which
stood
between
the
carriage
and
the
sun
,
she
became
gratefully
aware
of
the
cool
shade
cast
by
their
dense
foliage
.
On
her
lips
she
tasted
the
dust
raised
by
the
horses
'
hooves
and
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
.
But
these
small
experiences
had
the
remoteness
of
a
dream
.
Real
life
was
going
on
inside
her
.
She
felt
-
it
was
much
more
than
a
memory-Toss
Barnet
's
strong
hand
holding
hers
,
his
lips
on
her
cheek
.
She
raised
a
hand
to
touch
the
place
,
as
if
by
such
an
action
she
might
capture
the
feeling
forever
.
But
with
Sean
O'Farrell
around
,
the
silence
and
tranquillity
could
not
last
.
Ruth
had
no
idea
how
long
they
had
been
driving
when
Sean
turned
the
horses
off
the
road
on
to
a
narrow
side
track
.
It
was
the
sharp
turn
,
together
with
the
speed
of
his
driving
,
which
flung
Miss
Beard
over
on
to
Ruth
,
and
her
sharp
squeal
as
it
happened
which
brought
Ruth
back
to
reality
.
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
ladies
!
The
going
's
rough
just
here
.
"
From
the
wide
grin
on
Sean
's
face
as
he
turned
around
to
look
at
them
,
Ruth
suspected
that
he
had
swerved
on
purpose
.
"
Are
ye
all
right
,
Miss
Polly
?
"
he
asked
with
concern
.
"
I
'm
quite
all
right
,
Mr
O'Farrell
,
"
she
replied
.
"
I
'm
driving
down
towards
the
river
,
"
he
said
.
"
I
thought
perhaps
you
'd
like
to
stop
within
sight
of
it
.
"
The
ground
sloped
away
now
,
and
when
,
after
a
downhill
mile
,
Sean
stopped
the
carriage
,
there
before
them
was
the
Hudson
River
.
It
was
broader
than
Ruth
,
used
to
the
fast-flowing
rivers
of
Yorkshire
,
had
expected
,
and
was
busy
with
craft
plying
in
both
directions
.
"
Spread
the
rug
on
the
ground
,
Herbert
,
"
Sean
ordered
.
"
We
'll
have
it
right
there
.
"
He
indicated
a
patch
of
ground
near
some
willows
.
There
was
dappled
shade
for
those
who
preferred
it
or
,
by
moving
just
a
little
,
the
afternoon
sun
for
those
who
could
stand
the
heat
.
"
Now
,
Miss
Polly
,
"
Sean
said
.
"
What
's
your
pleasure
?
"
"
Oh
,
I
think
I
must
choose
the
shade
,
"
Miss
Beard
replied
.
"
Too
much
sun
spoils
the
complexion
.
"
"
And
that
's
a
risk
you
must
n't
run
,
"
Sean
said
gravely
.
Miss
Polly
took
his
words
as
a
compliment
and
treated
him
to
a
coy
smile
of
invitation
,
meant
to
suggest
that
he
should
sit
beside
her
;
but
Sean
had
already
marked
Herbert
Fraser
for
that
position
of
honour
,
stopping
just
short
of
pushing
him
to
the
ground
.
"
Herbert
's
the
same
,
"
he
smiled
.
"
Ca
n't
stand
the
sun
on
account
of
his
delicate
skin
!
"
He
winked
at
Ruth
as
he
indicated
the
place
where
she
might
sit
and
then
,
having
settled
them
all
to
his
liking
,
he
fetched
the
food
from
the
carriage
.
"
I
'm
pleased
to
say
Cook
relented
,
"
he
told
them
,
spreading
it
out
before
them
.
Ruth
thought
it
more
likely
that
his
silver
tongue
had
got
around
her
.
As
well
as
the
cake
-
light
,
fluffy
stuff
with
frosty
icing
and
no
body
to
it
,
Ruth
privately
thought
-
there
were
freshly
baked
rolls
,
split
and
filled
with
ox-tongue
.
Then
,
when
the
blackcurrant
cordial
was
poured
,
Herbert
Fraser
brought
a
flask
out
of
his
pocket
and

Ruth
had
the
feeling
that
he
was
desperately
trying
to
inject
a
bit
of
life
into
the
party

she
felt
guilty
that
she
,
for
one

had
so
far
been
very
dull
company

Herbert
Fraser
poured
the

into
her
glass

said

liberal

her

over
the

the
flask
came
in
her
direction

Once
,
she
being
childishly

given
her
a
sip
of
the

had
bought
to
ease
her
grandfather

had
hated
the
taste

it

spat
it
out
immediately
.
Not

Miss

She
sipped
at

cordial

evident
pleasure

Herbert
Fraser
offered
her
another

she
accepted

poured
himself
another

Miss
Beard
agreed
happily
.
Ruth
supposed
it
was
Miss
Beard
's
lack
of
acquaintance
with
alcohol
which
accounted
for
its
rapid
,

in
her
case
beneficial
,
effect
.
She
was
now
all
amiability

A
few
minutes
earlier
Ruth
would
have
welcomed
the
idea
of
everyone
going
off
to
sleep
(
not
that
Sean
showed
any
sign
of
doing
so
)
as
an
opportunity
for
her
to
indulge
in
her
own
thoughts
,
but
the
fits
of
uninhibited
laughter
had
restored
her
to
something
nearer
to
normality
,
and
at
last
she
was
present
with
her
companions
in
mind
as
well
as
in
the
flesh
.
Not
that
she
could
entirely
stop
thinking
about
Joss
Barnet
.
Whatever
happened
,
whatever
was
done
or
said
,
he
was
there
in
the
corner
of
her
mind
.
In
no
time
at
all
Miss
Beard
was
fast
asleep
.
She
lay
on
her
back
,
her
usually
sallow
face
rosy
,
her
mouth
open
and
emitting
regular
snores
which
,
though
reasonably
genteel
,
would
have
horrified
her
if
she
had
heard
them
.
Herbert
Fraser
's
snores
were
another
matter
:
a
robust
,
masculine
,
uninhibited
production
.
Moreover
,
they
did
not
time
themselves
well
with
Miss
Beard
's
.
Sean
looked
at
Ruth
and
they
started
to
laugh
again
,
but
since
neither
of
them
wished
to
waken
the
sleepers
they
stifled
their
mirth
.
"
Let's

Sean
whispered
.
Ruth
nodded
her
agreement
and
he
put
out
his
hand
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet
.
There
was
no
path
,
and
the
ground
was
too
stony
to
be
described
as
a
meadow
.
Outcroppings
of
dark
rock
,
large
and
small
and
sometimes
steep
,
interrupted
the
coarse
,
sunbrowned
grass
.

Ruth
had
never
heard
him
speak
with
any
seriousness
before
,
had
hardly
seen
him
without
a
smile
on
his
face
.
Now
there
was
longing
and
bitterness
in
his
voice
and
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
man
she
had
met
on
the
boat
.
"

both
in
their

forties
when
they
died

could

words
were
all
it
needed
to
remind
her
of
home
,

while
he
,

Ruth
was
fairly
sure
she
could

but
she
had
another
question
in
mind
of
greater
importance
.
"
Of
course

Mrs

assured

"
Excuse

Ruth
said
,
"
but
is
it
your
opinion
that
a
woman
can
attract
any
man
if
she
has
a
mind
to
?
"
Mrs
Carson
did
not
reply
at
once
and
Ruth
wondered
if
she
had
gone
too
far
and
annoyed
her
mistress
.
Mrs
Carson
was
peering
closely
at
her
own
image
in
the
mirror
.
She
smoothed
the
dark
wings
of
her
eyebrows
,
pinched
her
cheeks
to
make
the
colour
come
.
Then
she
studied
her
maid
's
reflection
in
the
glass
.
How
the
girl
had
changed
since
their
first
meeting
on
the
ship
!
She
had
been
a
little
waif
then
,
in
her
Yorkshire
homespun
.
Though
come
to
think
of
it
,
she
had
known
how
to
ask
for
what
she
wanted
.
But
now
she
had
an
air
of
confidence
a
bloom
on
her
skin
,
a
light
in
her
eyes
.
The
New
World
certainly
agreed
with
her
.
Yet
even
now
I
know
little
about
her
,
Mrs
Carson
thought
.
She
keeps
herself
to
herself
.
All
things
considered
,
she
would
be
better
married
.
She
turned
around
and
faced
Ruth
directly
.
"
Not
any
man
.
Not
any
woman
.
But
I
'm
sure
you
'd
have
no
difficulty
,
Ruth
.
"
The
dry
note
in
her
voice
did
not
escape
Ruth
.
When
Ruth
climbed
into
her
bed
that
night
Miss
Beard
was
packing
for
her
next
day
's
departure
and
she
was
far
more
talkative
than
usual
,
regaling
Ruth
with
the
names
and
pedigrees
of
notables
with
whom
she
might
be
privileged
to
breathe
the
same
air
.
She
longed
for
the
silly
woman
to
stop
prattling
and
to
blow
out
the
candle
.
She
wanted
to
lie
there
in
the
dark
,
alone
with
the
thoughts
she
had
had
to
suppress
for
so
much
of
the
day
.
Alas
for
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
!
Within
two
minutes
Ruth
was
fast
asleep
and
Miss
Beard
still
in
full
spate
.
But
next
morning
Ruth
awakened
early
and
,
leaving
Miss
Beard
to
her
gentle
dreams
,
dressed
quickly
and
hurried
out
of
the
house
.
It
was
another
golden
day
.
She
still
retained
her
English
habit
of
noting
each
day
's
weather
,
always
expecting
changes
,
marvelling
at
the
hot
sunny
days
which
followed
one
after
the
other
,
almost
with
monotony
.
When
she
reached
the
plateau
she
remained
standing
,
watching
for
Joss
Barnet
,
waiting
for
the
moment
when
she
would
see
him
riding
towards
her
.
There
was
no
longer
any
need
for
her
to
be
"
discovered
"
.
Her
sole
purpose
in
being
there
was
to
meet
him
and
she
was
content
that
he
should
know
it
.
He
was
late
this
morning
.
Or
was.she
earlier
than
she
thought
?
Had
she
misjudged
the
time
?
No
matter
.
She
was
happy
to
wait
for
him
,
certain
that
soon
she
would
see
him
riding
towards
her
.
Then
as
the
minutes
passed
and
there
was
no
sign
of
him
,
she
considered
that
perhaps
he
had
overslept
.
It
could
happen
.
Or
had
his
horse
gone
lame
,
cast
a
shoe
?
She
sat
down
and
prepared
to
wait
as
long
as
was
necessary
.
She
knew
that
in
the
end
he
would
come
.
After
a
few
more
minutes
she
became
restless
,
and
stood
up
again
,
her
eyes
searching
the
slope
of
the
hillside
and
the
valley
below
,
trying
to
determine
whether
some
small
movement
down
there
was
a
man
on
horseback
or
merely
a
trick
of
her
imagination
.
Should
she
set
off
down
the
hill
to
meet
him
?
But
perhaps
he
would
come
by
another
route
and
then
she
would
miss
him
.
At
the
end
of
what
she
reckoned
must
be
an
hour
,
she
faced
the
fact
that
he
was
not
coming
.
She
dropped
to
the
ground
again
and
lay
down
,
burying
her
face
in
the
sweet-smelling
grass
.
She
had
been
mistaken
ever
to
think
that
he
would
come
.
She
had
let
her
overwhelming
desire
feed
her
imagination
;
had
read
something
into
his
words
,
his
looks
,
his
actions
,
which
had
not
been
there
at
all
.
Her
face
burned
with
the
shame
of
it
.
Such
was
the
feeling
Joss
Barnet
had
aroused
in
her
,
that
not
for
one
moment
did
it
occur
to
her
to
blame
him
for
anything
.
It
was
all
her
fault
.
Sick
at
heart
,
she
wept
.
Then
she
dried
her
eyes
on
the
hem
of
her
petticoat
and
went
slowly
back
to
the
house
.
"

've

to
put

appearance

Cook

her
after
all

How
could
she
have
thought
that
he
would

Something
unforeseen
and
urgent
had
happened
,
since
Sean
had
obviously
known
of
it
yesterday
afternoon
,
and
there
had
been
no
opportunity
for
him
to
inform
her
.
Relief
surged
through
her
like
a
physical
infusion
of
new
blood
.
"

she
said

Ruth
worked
all
that
day
as

she
had
the
strength
of
ten

off

Mrs

went
on
.

Not

Ruth
said
after
the
child
had
gone
to
sleep
.
Mrs
Carson
smiled
indulgently
.
"
Dearest
Anna
!
She
's
a
little
young
for
a
holiday
infatuation
,
but
we
all
have
them
sooner
or
later

goodness
they
never
last

And
the
more
intense

are
,
the
shorter
the
duration
,

should
soon
be

"

Ruth
asked
.
"
I
expect
you
mean
will
O'Farrell
be
back
,
"
Mrs
Carson
said
.
"
And
the
answer
is
,
I
do
n't
know
.
Mrs
Barnet
tells
me
that
she
expects
her
husband
when
she
sees
him
.
It
's
a
fact
that
American
men
seem
to
put
business
before
everything
.
Thank
goodness
Englishmen
are
not
like
that
!
"
Next
morning
Ruth
was
down
in
the
kitchen
early
,
eagerly
hoping
to
find
Sean
there
.
He
could
well
have
returned
late
at
night
and
she
not
heard
him
,
though
she
had
stayed
awake
for
a
long
time
,
listening
for
the
sound
of
the
horses
,
the
carriage
wheels
on
the
drive
.
There
was
no
sign
of
Sean
but
Mrs
Cranbrook
was
already
at
work
.
"
I
hope
you
're
ready
to
help
me
,
"
she
said
.
"
Everybody
is
busy
with
this
and
that
-
as
if
food
was
n't
the
most
important
thing
!
"
"
I
'll
help
,
Mrs
Cranbrook
,
"
Ruth
agreed
.
"
They
're
not
back
then
?
"
She
tried
to
sound
nonchalant
.
"
Not
back
?
Oh
,
you
mean
O'Farrell
and
the
master
?
Not
that
I
know
of
.
There
's
no
telling
when
they
"
U
return
.
Sometimes
they
're
gone
for
three
or
four
days
at
a
time
.
"
"
But
surely
-
with
the
party
?
"
Mrs
Cranbrook
shrugged
.
"
He
's
a
law
unto
himself
,
the
master
.
Not
for
the
likes
of
you
and
me
to
question
why
.
"
The
heart
had
gone
out
of
the
day
.
Ruth
fetched
and
carried
and
stirred
and
whipped
,
praying
every
moment
that
Joss
Barnet
would
return
before
they
left
Millfield
next
day
.
But
when
the
day
had
dragged
to
evening
-
in
spite
of
all
there
was
to
do
the
time
now
passed
slowly
-
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
the
two
men
,
she
began
to
lose
hope
.
In
the
evening
,
bone-tired
,
she
left
the
kitchen
and
went
to
put
a
reluctant
Anna
to
bed
.
Then
she
turned
to
helping
Mrs
Carson
.
She
brushed
her
mistress
's
hair
and
piled
it
on
top
of
her
head
in
a
cluster
of
curls
,
carefully
and
meticulously
arranged
to
look
quite
casual
.
It
was
a
style
Ruth
had
devised
herself
and
Mrs
Carson
was
delighted
with
the
result
.
"
It
looks
so
different
,
"
she
said
.
"
You
really
are
quite
clever
at
this
,
Ruth
.
And
now
for
my
dress
.
"
She
looked
beautiful
in
the
yellow
satin
,
the
low-cut
bodice
tight
against
her
slight
figure
,
the
skirt
billowing
out
.
But
Ruth
had
no
heart
either
to
appreciate
or
to
envy
her
mistress
.
Her
spirits
were
at
their
lowest
ebb
.
Mrs
Carson
gave
her
maid
a
sharp
,
compassionate
look
.
She
thought
she
knew
the
cause
of
this
mood
and
in
a
way
she
was
glad
to
see
it
.
At
least
it
showed
that
the
girl
's
mind
was
working
in
the
right
direction
.
"
Do
n't
worry
,
Ruth
,
"
she
said
kindly
.
"
I
dare
say
O'Farrell
will
be
back
tomorrow
before
we
leave
.
And
if
not
,
there
is
always
New
York
when
the
Barnets
return
in
the
fall
.
And
now
I
sha
n't
need
you
again
this
evening
,
so
apart
from
looking
in
on
Anna
from
time
to
time
,
you
may
do
just
as
you
please
.
"
Had
she
not
been
so
downhearted
Ruth
would
have
enjoyed
herself
.
But
she
had
given
up
all
hope
of
Joss
Barnet
returning
that
evening
and
nothing
else
in
the
world
mattered
.
The
party
scene
was
pretty
enough
.
Coloured
lanterns
hung
in
the
trees
which
fringed
the
lawn
and
bordered
the
lake
beyond
.
Torchlights
,
flaring
against
the
night
sky
and
reflected
in
the
water
,
had
been
set
up
wherever
it
was
suitable
.
Already
the
orchestra
had
begun
to
play
and
the
elegantly
dressed
to
appear
.
Ruth
had
no
heart
for
it
.
She
climbed
the
stairs
to
her
room
,
then
undressed
and
went
to
bed
,
wetting
the
pillow
with
her
tears
which
,
held
back
all
day
,
now
flowed
unchecked
.
Her
only
comfort
was
not
to
have
Miss
Beard
in
her
room
,
to
be
able
to
suffer
in
solitude
.
Though
she
thought
sleep
would
never
come
,
eventually
it
did
.
She
fell
asleep
to
the
sound
of
music
drifting
upwards
from
the
drawing-room
.
When
she
wakened
it
was
still
dark
,
the
orchestra
still
playing
,
though
it
was
not
that
which
had
aroused
her
.
Penetrating
her
sleep
she
had
heard
the
faint
click
of
the
door
latch
,
and
then
the
familiar
squeak
of
the
hinge
as
the
door
to
her
room
slowly
opened
.
She
raised
herself
on
one
elbow
,
blinking
her
eyes
,
trying
to
see
in
the
darkness
.
But
enough
light
came
from
the
landing
on
to
which
the
door
opened
to
silhouette
the
man
standing
there
.
It
was
Joss
Barnet
.
Shock
made
her
cry
out
,
and
he
closed
the
door
and
moved
towards
her
in
quick
strides
,
putting
his
hand
across
her
mouth
to
stop-her
scream
.
Then
he
sat
on
her
bed
and
,
without
a
word
from
either
of
them
,
she
went
willingly
into
his
arms
and
was
held
close
in
his
embrace
.
She
felt
his
heart
beating
strong
and
fast
against
hers
.
They
stayed
like
that
for
a
long
moment
and
then
he
said
,
"
Light
the
candle
.
"
"
I
ca
n't
,
"
she
whispered
.
"
Someone
will
see
the
light
under
the
door
.
"
"
No
matter
if
they
do
,
"
he
said
.
"
They
will
not
think
of
me
here
.
Only
my
coachman
knows
I
am
home
.
I
have
not
yet
joined
the
party
.
"
"
You
came
to
me
first
?
"
She
could
hardly
believe
it
.
He
would
not
tell
her
,
this
funny
bewitching
little
English
girl
,
that
he
had
come
to
her
first
because
he
could
not
keep
away
from
her
.
She
had
been
on
his
mind
since
the
morning
he
had
seen
her
from
his
horse
;
frightened
yet
defiant
,
sparking
with
anger
.
Almost
,
but
not
quite
,
she
had
come
between
him
and
the
work
he
had
had
to
do
in
New
York
City
.
The
moment
the
work
was
done
he
had
ordered
his
coachman
to
drive
him
back
to
Millfield
as
fast
as
the
horses
would
go
.
"
Light
the
candle
,
"
he
repeated
.
Ruth
's
fingers
trembled
as
she
obeyed
him
.
Then
she
lay
back
on
her
pillow
and
they
looked
at
each
other
as
if
it
was
for
the
first
time
.
He
traced
the
contours
of
her
face
with
gentle
fingers
,
outlining
the
curve
of
her
mouth
,
stroking
her
temples
.
Without
any
hurry
,
in
spite
of
the
impatience
which
had
brought
him
here
,
he
caressed
the
length
of
her
neck
and
the
slope
of
her
shoulders
.
From
out
of
nowhere
,
Ruth
remembered
Dick
Parker
:
but
not
,
this
time
,
the
pleasure
of
her
union
with
him
,
only
the
pain
it
had
brought
her
on
the
Christmas
Eve
following
.
And
now
although
her
whole
body
cried
out
for
fulfilment
and
she
longed
for
Joss
Barnet
to
complete
what
he
had
surely
come
to
do
,
she
knew
that
she
must
not
let
it
happen
.
She
turned
her
face
away
from
him
,
pushed
his
hand
from
her
.
"
No
!
"
she
cried
.
"
You
must
not
!
"
He
gave
not
the
slightest
sign
of
having
heard
her
,
continuing
to
stroke
her
neck
,
and
now
inserting
his
fingers
under
the
neckline
of
her
nightshift
.
She
tried
again
to
push
him
away
.
"
Please
!
Please
do
n't
!
"
she
cried
.
It
was
surprise
which
made
him
stop
for
a
second
.
He
smiled
at
her
,
an
unexpectedly
tender
smile
.
"
I
wo
n't
hurt
you
,
"
he
said
.
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
"
"
I
'm
not
afraid
of
being
hurt
.
"
"
Then
what
-
?
"
"
I
'm
afraid
of
afterwards
,
"
she
said
hesitantly
.
"
If
I
were
to
have
a
child
.
It
would
be
the
end
of
the
world
for
me
.
"
"
But
you
wo
n't
,
"
he
assured
her
.
"
I
'll
see
to
that
.
I
'm
not
totally
callous
.
"
"
You
promise
?
"
"
I
promise
.
"
She
lay
quiescent
and
felt
his
strong
fingers
,
quicker
now
,
move
to
unfasten
the
buttons
of
her
shift
one
by
one
.
And
when
he
had
undone
her
gown
,
and
had
difficulty
in
lifting
it
over
her
head
,
she
raised
herself
from
the
pillow
and
helped
him
to
take
it
off
.
Then
he
pulled
down
the
sheet
,
which
was
all
the
bedclothes
she
had
needed
on
that
warm
night
,
and
she
lay
naked
before
him
.
She
observed
him
without
shame
as
he
looked
at
every
part
of
her
.
Her
pleasure
was
in
him
,
and
in
his
delight
of
her
.
When
,
at
last
,
he
stripped
off
his
clothes
and
came
into
her
,
it
was
as
if
this
was
the
moment
to
which
all
her
life
had
been
leading
.
He
was
a
skilful
lover
:
tender
and
gentle
in
the
beginning
,
then
powerful
,
persistent
,
rough
almost
-
until
,
his
passion
rising
in
harmony
with
hers
,
the
climax
came
like
the
bursting
of
a
thousand
stars
,
like
the
beginning
and
ending
of
the
world
.
Afterwards
they
lay
quietly
side
by
side
,
not
speaking
,
until
he
said
,
"
I
must
go
.
"
"
Not
yet
,
"
she
begged
.
"
You
ca
n't
leave
me
yet
.
"
She
turned
over
and
lay
on
top
of
him
,
trying
to
pin
him
down
with
her
own
slight
weight
,
and
he
began
to
fondle
her
and
she
him
,
and
almost
at
once
they
were
making
love
again
.
"
You
are
a
sorceress
,
"
he
told
her
when
it
was
all
over
.
"
An
enchantress
.
Women
as
tempting
as
you
should
be
kept
out
of
the
sight
of
mortal
men
.
"
"
You
're
not
a
mortal
man
,
"
Ruth
said
.
"
You
're
a
god
!
"
He
laughed
out
loud
.
"
Hush
!
"
she
cautioned
.
"
Someone
will
hear
you
.
"
"
I
'm
a
real
man
all
right
,
"
he
said
.
"
As
I
've
just
proved
to
you
.
And
would
again
if
time
allowed
.
"
Then
he
stood
up
and
quickly
began
to
dress
.
"
I
must
go
and
do
my
duty
as
a
host
for
what
's
left
of
the
night
.
"
"
Do
n't
leave
me
,
"
she
begged
.
"
Please
stay
!
"
He
looked
at
her
in
surprise
,
spoke
brusquely
.
"
But
of
course
I
must
go
.
There
's
no
question
.
"
Long
afterwards
Ruth
realised
that
this
was
the
moment
when
she
had
learned
that
she
could
never
come
first
with
him
.
However
much
he
might
desire
her
,
she
would
have
no
more
than
the
allotted
space
in
his
life
.
"
When
am
I
going
to
see
you
again
?
"
she
asked
.
That
,
also
,
was
the
wrong
thing
to
say
.
"
I
ca
n't
make
plans
,
"
he
said
sharply
.
"
But
we
leave
tomorrow
!
"
she
exclaimed
.
That
took
him
by
surprise
.
"
The
deuce
you
do
!
Well
I
shall
see
to
that
.
My
wife
will
extend
the
invitation
to
the
Carsons
.
I
take
it
they
're
not
promised
elsewhere
?
"
"
Oh
no
,
"
Ruth
said
.
"
We
're
going
back
to
New
York
City
.
"
He
finished
dressing
,
then
came
and
held
her
by
the
shoulders
,
kissing
her
lightly
on
the
mouth
.
As
he
was
leaving
he
turned
around
and
threw
a
small
box
on
to
the
bed
.
"
From
the
city
,
"
he
said
.
"
You
see
that
I
had
you
in
my
mind
!
"
He
was
out
of
the
room
before
she
could
open
the
box
,
a
dark
blue
leather
affair
,
lined
with
white
velvet
,
against
which
lay
a
fine
gold
chain
with
a
small
oval
locket
set
around
the
edge
with
seed
pearls
.
She
gasped
in
amazement
.
It
was
without
doubt
the
most
beautiful
thing
she
had
ever
owned
,
or
ever
would
.
Such
delicacy
,
such
refinement
!
Her
fingers
trembling
with
excitement
,
she
fastened
it
around
her
neck
.
It
should
remain
there
for
ever
.
She
would
never
take
it
off
.
