It
's
no
news
that
memory
is
deceitful
.
I
have
tried
to
explain
that
in
Claudia
's
case
memory
is
particularly
treacherous
,
but
Letterman
likes
the
idea
of
ambiguity
.
He
sees
it
as
European
,
a
kind
of
intellectual
chic
,
useful
to
our
story
.
He
has
come
a
long
way
since
he
worked
as
a
production
runner
with
James
Wong
Howe
and
Martin
Ritt
in
a
coal-mining
village
in
Pennsylvania
.
I
suspect
his
own
memory
is
a
little
unreliable
;
in
his
telling
he
was
Martin
Ritt
's
right-hand
man
and
Sean
Connery
's
golfing
partner
after
just
one
week
.
He
is
self-deprecating
but
ail
his
anecdotes
feature
his
achievements
.
Whatever
the
ostensible
subject
matter
,
Letterman
-
as
clapper
loader
,
assistant
director
,
co-author
,
executive
producer
-
emerges
from
the
narrative
undergrowth
muddled
,
festooned
in
foliage
,
sometimes
even
bloodied
,
but
always
victorious
.
Muthaiga
Club
,
where
I
am
staying
,
releases
forgotten
gusts
of
memory
,
like
those
lilies
which
only
exhale
their
sweet
perfume
at
night
.
My
father
was
happiest
in
places
like
this
.
He
loved
clubs
and
wardrooms
with
the
pre-dinner
drinks
,
the
discreet
signing
of
chitties
,
the
smiling
elderly
waiters
(
from
a
class
almost
extinct
now
,
men
who
lived
to
serve
other
men
)
.
I
remember
arriving
in
my
father
's
Pontiac
at
clubs
just
like
this
,
sweeping
(
not
always
silently
;
the
car
was
old
)
down
to
the
front
door
to
be
deposited
and
greeted
,
to
be
called
"
sir
"
by
elderly
black
men
.
I
remember
running
on
the
rolling
lawns
of
Kikuyu
grass
before
dinner
,
the
night
noises
of
the
exceptionally
vocal
African
insect
life
striking
up
as
it
quickly
grew
dark
,
night
unrolling
from
the
ground
upwards
;
bullfrogs
-
in
fact
all
manner
of
rana
and
bufo-frogs
the
size
of
a
pair
of
roiled-up
rugby
socks
,
toads
with
great
horned
eyebrows
,
and
tiny
,
reddish
,
darting
amphibians
,
starting
to
howl
,
shriek
,
growl
,
and
purr
,
a
backdrop
to
our
dinner
on
the
terrace
to
which
we
have
been
summoned
by
the
stirring
,
thrilling
,
beating
of
a
gong
hung
from
a
pair
of
tusks
.
We
sit
straight
,
elbows
tucked
in
,
endless
soup
spoons
,
fish
knives
and
butter
knives
to
deal
with
.
"
A
gentleman
is
a
man
who
uses
the
butter
knife
even
when
his
wife
is
not
at
home
,
"
said
my
father
,
only
two-thirds
joking
.
The
dinner
itself
,
a
ritual
of
many
courses
,
begins
to
emerge
in
relays
from
the
swing
doors
of
the
kitchen
,
the
food
bland
and
unexceptionable
,
but
plentiful
and
somehow
sanctified
by
being
served
by
the
immaculate
waiters
in
sashes
and
gloves
.
So
Muthaiga
Club
is
instantly
familiar
.
My
room
looks
out
over
a
croquet
lawn
,
at
the
end
of
which
is
a
pond
thickly
planted
with
papyrus
-
the
eponymous
plant
always
mentioned
by
school
teachers
in
any
history
of
written
language
-
in
which
,
I
know
with
certainty
,
all
hell
will
break
loose
as
dusk
falls
.
High
on
the
wall
of
my
room
,
near
the
open
window
,
waiting
for
the
lights
to
come
on
,
a
gecko
is
clinging
on
hopefully
to
the
knobbly
plaster
.
Unlike
other
members
of
the
reptile
family
,
the
gecko
is
a
benign
creature
,
cheery
,
opportunistic
and
patently
useful
.
I
am
troubled
by
the
thought
that
this
familiar
world
into
which
I
am
able
to
slip
without
a
moment
's
readjustment
,
is
a
vanishing
world
.
The
club
is
now
written
up
in
style
magazines
;
models
are
photographed
with
the
head
waiter
.
(
Models
are
often
photographed
surrounded
by
nearly
naked
Masai
warriors
.
)
The
world
of
fashion
and
advertising
(
from
which
Victoria
has
not
quite
made
her
escape
-
she
is
like
someone
with
one
boot
stuck
deep
in
the
mud
,
unable
to
move
either
way
)
now
uses
places
like
that
as
themes
for
new
looks
or
as
inspiration
for
"
lifestyles
"
.
S.
O.
Letterman
has
something
similar
in
mind
,
a
re-creation
of
colonial
Africa
,
as
seen
from
Santa
Monica
Boulevard
.
Right
here
,
in
Muthaiga
,
colonial
Africa
lives
on
.
But
does
it
live
self-consciously
,
or
blithely
as
it
did
when
I
was
a
child
?
I
am
as
aware
as
anyone
of
the
changes
going
on
in
the
world
.
I
earn
my
living
by
observing
them
and
commenting
on
them
.
But
coming
here
has
made
me
realize
how
much
time
has
passed
since
,
as
a
small
boy
,
we
used
to
set
off
for
dinners
and
functions
.
I
have
probably
not
heard
or
read
the
phrase
"
beetle
drive
"
in
my
adult
life
,
yet
on
the
noticeboard
of
the
club
,
just
under
the
list
of
aspirant
members
duly
proposed
and
seconded
and
posted
,
is
the
announcement
of
a
beetle
drive
in
aid
of
the
library
fund
.
The
notice
is
signed
by
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
Hon.
Secretary
,
Library
Committee
.
I
remember
the
frenzy
of
a
beetle
drive
,
the
wings
,
the
little
legs
,
the
stubby
pencils
,
the
cries
of
"
beetle
"
,
the
powdering
of
the
noses
,
the
soda
siphons
fizzing
.
Proust
(
who
was
a
near
neighbour
and
acquaintance
of
Leon
Cohn-Casson
)
thought
that
memory
could
unlock
the
imagination
.
He
was
always
searching
,
rummaging
:
Les
vrais
paradis
sont
les
paradis
qu'on
a
perdus
.
I
fear
it
can
throttle
imagination
.
These
memories
which
are
summoned
here
in
Africa
seem
to
me
like
tendrils
of
vines
attaching
themselves
to
me
.
They
have
in
them
presages
of
mortality
;
I
have
a
feeling
that
there
is
now
more
of
my
past
life
than
my
future
.
And
I
am
aware
of
my
past
life
;
I
feel
it
looming
up
behind
me
,
breathing
lightly
on
the
nape
of
my
neck
.

a
thin
chain
to
a
sort

lectern
.
The
head
waiter
already
has
my
name
memorized
.
I
take
a
stroll
in
the
sonorous
gardens
.
There
is
a
sudden
flurry
outside
the
main
entrance
,
a
Gothic
porch
.
The
evening
is
closing
,
a
mist
rising
in
the
hollows
of
the
golf
course
.
The
waiters
are
folding
napkins
,
the
insects
are
tuning
up
vigorously
,
the
first
croaks
and
ululations
rise
from
the
pond
,
the
damp
earth
breathes
out
aromatically
,
the
exotic
flowers
pump
out
their
night
perfumes
,
the
sky
in
the
distance
over
the
knuckles
of
Ngong
,
the
direction
of
Masailand
,
flails
with
electricity
.
(
It
seems
more
like
buckets
of
thin
paint
dropped
from
the
sky
than
lightning
.
)
In
the
Delamere
rooms
a
pianist
is
playing
"
Young
Love
"
and
from
the
kitchen
comes
a
waft
of
roasting
meat
.
The
flurry
is
caused
by
the
arrival
of
an
old
car
,
of
a
type
that
retains
a
kind
of
dignity
as
it
ages
.
Lady
De
Marr
arrives
every
evening
,
God
willing
,
in
this
old
banger
.
I
watch
her
arrival
.
She
knew
Claudia
very
well
;
they
used
to
go
to
parties
together
dressed
as
boys
.
Now
Lady
De
Marr
staggers
into
the
front
door
,
saluted
by
the
guard
,
the
askari
,
disdaining
the
proffered
help
of
the
major-domo
,
who
wears
a
fez
and
a
sash
.
Another
man
drives
her
car
away
to
park
it
.
He
does
this
gravely
,
perhaps
fearing
-
with
some
justification
from
what
I
can
see
-
that
the
whole
thing
might
collapse
like
a
car
in
a
Laurel
and
Hardy
movie
,
falling
absolutely
fiat
on
to
the
ground
in
its
component
parts
.
I
hear
her
voice
complaining
of
the
ill-manners
of
the
police
at
a
road
block
.
It
is
a
voice
unaffected
by
the
changes
in
articulation
which
have
taken
place
since
the
1930s
.
She
pronounces
the
word
"
damn
"
with
a
little
gurgle
of
amusement
:
"
Dem
cheek

Bloody

Silly
arses
.
Somebody
should
tell
them
to

orff
and
catch
some
criminals

"
Nobody
can
reproduce
this
intonation
.
Actors
and
actresses
produce
a
version
of
Noel
Coward
when
they
try

I
follow
after
an
interval
towards
the
entrance
.
The
frogs
are
already
deafening
.
Claudia
Cohn-Casson
often
had
dinner
here
when
she
was
in
Nairobi
.
She
sometimes
had
dinner
with
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
who
tonight
is
having
dinner
with
Lady
De
Marr
.
I
wish
to
observe
this
,
because
I
find
the
prospect
of
two
octogenarians
having
dinner
in
the
middle
of
Africa
moving
.
The
intensely
familiar
surroundings
,
the
froggy
air
,
the
starched
linen
earnestly
folded
,
even
the
little
fake
candle
holders
on
the
wall
with
their
chintz
shades
,
shunt
my
real
life
,
my
sexual
wrangles
with
Victoria
,
my
work
,
to
one
side
.
This
uninvited
,
almost
uncontrollable
,
welling
of
memory
is
like
finding
a
hard
splinter
in
the
soft
,
flabby
flesh
of
my
real
life
.
But
also
I
am
suffering
a
pleasurable
and
painful
feeling
,
a
feeling
so
often
made
banal
by
film
,
of
time
reprieved
and
relived
.
Here
I
am
,
for
Chrissakes
,
about
to
dine
alongside
two
people
who
knew
Claudia
Cohn-Casson
,
in
surroundings
she
knew
well
,
in
an
ambience
which
I
know
ail
too
well
,
although
I
have
only
just
arrived
.
After
dinner
,
like
some
cultural
tourist
,
I
will
introduce
myself
to
these
envoys
from
the
past
.
A
gong
booms
.
The
sound
makes
small
silverfish
run
down
the
back
of
my
neck
.
I
am
,
as
my
father
used
to
say
,
going
to
have

works

start
with
a
consomme
Lady
Curzon

Even
in
the
soup
,
the
old
order
is
commemorated
.

tactile
abilities

the
candle
provided
for
such
occasions
and
try
to
strike
a
match

The

These
are
forgotten
rituals

a
living
chiaroscuro

Lit
in
this
way
a

is
a
simulacrum

dream
world
.
As

up
,
heading
for

I
see
a
piece
of
paper
under
my
door

It
is
the
club
's
notepaper
and
written
on

are
these
words
:
One
had
to

because
one
could
not

thought

that
this
graceful
,
fragile
,
tender
young
woman
with
those
eyes
,
that
smile
(
those
gardens
and
snows
in
the
background
)
had
been
brought
in

cattle
car

camp

killed
by
an
injection
of
phenol
into
the
heart

gentle
heart
that
one
had
heard
beating
under
one
's
lips
in
the
dusk
of
the

the
Lolita
chap
,

they
express
better
than

could
my

had

forget

As
I
am
sure
you
already
know
,
I
loved
her
.
But
I
had
to
forget

not
to
cheapen
her
life

Tom
I
picture
the
old
man
hopping
and
pacing
to
his
cottage
,
finding
the
paper
,
finding
the
passage
,
transcribing
it
,
bobbing
back
to
the
club
and
slipping
the
note
under
my
door
,
in
order
to
set
the
record
straight
;
I
find
myself
close
to
tears
.
The
candlelight
in
the
room
wavers
in
a
warm
draught
.
In
the
shadows
and
its
gentle
movement
I
believe
I
see
the
firelight
which
constrains
and
defines
the
Masai
night
.
Beyond
the
firelight
there
is
the
unknowable
.
Why
do
we
persist
in
trying
to
know
everything
there
is
to
know
in
the
belief
that
one
day
,
presumably
quite
soon
,
we
will
succeed
?
One
had
to
forget
.
Nabokov
's
words

Fairfax

words
.
They
could
easily
be
rephrased

one
could
not
understand

he
was
right

I

has
burned
right
down
so
that
in
the
enamel
holder
there
is
nothing
but
a
lava
flow
or
wax
.
Outside
I
can
hear
a
sound
which
is
also
achingly
familiar
to
me
:
someone
is
trimming
the
grass
outside
with
shears
.
They
chatter
and
stutter
in
the
never-ending
colonial
quest
for
the
perfect
lawn
,
which
is
,
of
course
,
a
reproach
to
the
disorderly
lives
and
vegetation
on
the
outside

with
tennis
.
However
well
he
does
,
however
badly
he
is
beaten
,
he
contrives
to
incorporate
the
result
into
his
bil-dungsroman
.
Like
Marcel
Proust
,
he
is
making
art
out
of
his
life
,
and
tennis
is
an
important
element
.
When
we
played
at
his
club
in
Westwood
and
I
beat
him
comfortably
,
he
discussed
the
result
with
his
friends
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
clear
that
he
had
deliberately
thrown
the
match
in
order
to
contribute
to
our
personal
relationship
.
In
the
locker
room
-
no
ordinary
changing
room
this
,
but
a
soft
paradise
of
fluffy
towels
,
hairdryers
,
lotions
,
masseurs
,
electronic
scales
,
isometric
drinks
,
cardio-vascular
scans
and
congratulatory
attendants
-
he
told
a
well-known
(
everyone
in
this
club
is
said
to
be
well-known
)
producer
that
he
took
the
first
three
games
off
me
in
each
set
.
And
then
he
added
that
,
of
course
,
writers
had
nothing
better
to
do
most
afternoons
and
since
I
was
now
writing
a
movie
for
him
,
he
knew
how
to
keep
me
happy
.
"
You
ca
n't
let
these
guys
get
depressed
,
"
he
said
.
"
Writing
is
a
mood
business
.
"
Somebody
told
me
that
Letterman
had
had
five
hundred
tennis
lessons
.
It
was
said
with
a
"
whaddya
expect
?
"
kind
of
intonation
.
Not
everyone
,
it
seems
,
has
bought
his
bill
of
goods
.
Certainly
his
tennis
has
an
entirely
synthetic
look
to
it
.
There
is
a
small
,
and
often
fatal
,
time
lapse
before
he
plays
each
shot
,
as
he
recalls
the
instructions
concerning
grip
,
feet
placement
,
racquet
position
and
so
on
.
None
the
less
,
his
tennis
has
high
ambitions
.
He
has
all
the
latest
equipment-vibration
dampers
,
elbow
restraints
,
luminous
head
and
wrist
bands
and
bicycle
shorts
under
his
strangely
textured
tennis
shorts
.
His
racquets
-
there
are
many
-
are
transported
in
a
bulging
bag
described
with
a
crocodile
,
given
to
him
by
Michel
Piccoli
.
"
Very
brave
man
.
He
signed
a
petition
you
know
against
Mitterrand
and
Vichy
.
Real
shame
our
movie
never
got
past
first
base
.
Anyway
,
this
bag
is
a
little
souvenir
.
Mitterrand
wrote
articles
for
a
Vichy
newspaper
before
he
joined
the
Resistance
.
Did
you
know
that
?
"
He
has
had
plenty
of
flirtations
with
European
directors
and
writers
and
claims
to
be
a
great
fan
of
Louis
Malle
and
Alain
Resnais
,
but
when
it
comes
right
down
to
it
,
he
does
n't
believe
that
a
European
sensibility
sells
tickets
at
the
box
office
.
Yet
he
can
work
both
sides
of
the
street
.
In
argument
about
the
treatment
of
the
script
-
these
things
process
in
ordered
stages
-
he
is
just
as
likely
to
enlist
Bergman
as
Schwarzenegger
as
supporting
evidence
.
Like
his
tennis
,
his
movie-making
seems
to
lack
instinct
,
but
half
an
hour
in
the
locker
room
and
lunch
on
the
terrace
tells
you
everything
you
need
to
know
about
the
constraints
under
which
he
operates
.
Papal
bulls
issued
from
the
Hollywood
Vatican
flutter
in
the
air
.
There
are
prescriptions
concerning
actors
,
restaurants
,
religious
sects
,
fads
,
social
issues
and
automobiles
which
you
ignore
at
peril
of
excommunication
.
The
insiders
-
and
Letterman
is
right
on
the
inside
track
-
pick
up
these
changing
signals
constantly
;
they
have
no
patience
with
outsiders
'
scepticism
.
I
am
reminded
of
Letterman
's
tennis
because
as
I
stroll
through
the
grounds
of
the
club
,
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
my
transcripts
,
I
come
upon
a
red
earth
tennis
court
.
The
surface
of
these
courts
is
made
with
a
clay
brought
up
from
underground
by
termites
,
the
insects
which
create
the
famous
anthills
of
the
savannah
.
Nobody
is
playing
as
yet
,
but
the
lines
have
been
freshly
painted
,
a
large
old
roller
is
being
stored
by
an
elderly
man
with
tribal
scars
on
his
cheeks
(
like
the
marks
made
by
French
grill
pans
on
bifteck
)
,
and
a
big
jug
of
lemon
squash
is
standing
in
the
shade
of
a
little
thatched
tennis
house
,
protected
from
the
desires
of
wasps
and
flies
by
a
beaded
lace
doily
.
Beside
the
court
a
bed
of
yellow
canna
lilies
,
with
leaves
the
colour
of
red
cabbage
,
is
being
doused
by
another
retainer
,
this
man
with
a
little
ornament
,
beaded
like
the
doily
,
in
one
of
his
ear
lobes
.
The
water
bounces
off
the
waxen
leaves
.
It
was
Letterman
's
idea
to
use
the
awful
journey
from
the
house
in
the
avenue
Hoche
via
Drancy
to
Auschwitz
as
a
recurring
,
dreamlike
image
in
the
film
.
Letterman
had
previously
told
me
that
flashback
is
a
device
which
must
be
used
sparingly
,
yet
now
he
was
a
plausible
advocate
for
this
treatment
.
It
appeals
to
me
,
too
.
The
final
,
defiant
round-up
by
the
retreating
Nazis
,
in
which
Claudia
and
her
deluded
father
were
caught
,
the
train
journey
and
the
selection
process
at
Auschwitz
,
will
all
be
treated
in
black
and
white
,
in
order
,
if
I
get
Letterman
,
to
increase
the
realism
and
to
reduce
the
melodrama
.
I
can
see
that
his
aim
is
to
make
these
scenes
so
powerful
that
they
will
go
beyond
any
fictional
treatment
of
the
death
camps
that
has
ever
been
tried
before
:
the
train
roils
through
the
night
,
the
outcome
,
although
certain
,
appallingly
delayed
by
the
shots
of
the
iron
wheels
and
the
crude
pistons
;
the
final
scene
of
the
five
chimneys
pouring
their
shameful
smoke
over
the
polish
countryside
,
intercut
-
this
is
my
contribution
-
with
the
smoke
rising
from
the
savannah
.
Letterman
confided
to
me
after
one
of
our
tennis
games
that
my
pieces
in
Manhattan
had
always
struck
him
as
somewhat
trivial
-
artifices
-
until
he
read
my
piece
"
Drancy
,
Ante-chamber
of
Death
"
.
The
mundane
details
of
the
denunciations
,
the
decrees
against
Jews
using
the
telephone
or
travelling
on
the
Metro
and
so
on
had
brought
home
to
him
that
the
French
had
both
suffered
by
and
been
complicit
in
the
Holocaust
.
(
I
forgave
the
fact
that
he
was
merely
paraphrasing
my
final
sentence
.
He
has
a
way
of
drawing
you
into
his
enterprises
,
which
is
flattering
.
)
Still
nobody
comes
to
play
tennis
.
The
lines
are
painted
,
the
canna
lilies
watered
.
The
lines
are
perfectly
straight
,
their
whiteness
defying
the
ochre
ant
soil
.
On
the
cabbage
leaves
of
the
cannas
,
huge
,
shining
droplets
of
water
repose
.
Letterman
told
me
that
he
once
saw
Steffi
Graf
playing
tennis
at
Wimbledon
.
He
was
seated
at
the
back
of
the
court
,
initially
angry
that
someone
had
screwed
up
with
the
tickets
,
but
he
quickly
realized
that
every
few
games
he
was
almost
directly
behind
her
.
Each
time
she
bent
to
receive
serve
he
found
himself
staring
mesmerized
at
her
derriere
.
Binding
me
with
his
confidences
,
he
said
that
the
wonderfully
athletic
,
Aryan
rear
view
of
Steffi
Graf
made
him
understand
how
the
camp
inmates
could
believe
they
were
indeed
Untermenschen
in
relation
to
the
SS
.
He
was
joking
,
of
course
.
He
squeezed
my
arm
to
make
sure
I
got
the
point
.
The
grounds
of
the
club
lead
to
a
golf
course
,
but
this
,
too
,
is
still
,
except
for
the
attentions
of
green-sweepers
and
grass-cutters
.
The
first
fairway
extends
up
over
a
gentle
rise
and
into
a
forest
of
huge
,
native
trees
.
These
are
the
only
trees
around
the
town
which
have
not
yet
gone
for
firewood
.
The
town
has
an
edgy
,
vicious
hum
.
The
poor
see
the
lumpy
,
soapy
tourists
and
they
harbour
thoughts
of
separating
them
from
their
possessions
.
A
short
walk
near
the
university
produces
the
dispiriting
impression
that
urban
life
in
Africa
is
hopeless
.
In
their
smart
uniforms
the
police
have
a
lethargic
menace
.
A
large
Mercedes
rushes
by
with
outriders
;
the
other
traffic
-
held
together
with
recycled
parts
,
bits
of
wire
and
home
engineering
-
is
swept
aside
dismissively
,
mere
twigs
in
the
path
of
floodwater
.
I
wish
to
run
up
to
the
window
of
the
Mercedes
and
shout
at
the
general
sitting
there
:
Wake
up
,
you
fat
bastard
,
ca
n't
you
see
how
you
look
parading
in
this
cemetery
,
like
some
overstuffed
SS
officer
in
Birkenau
?
Yet
when
I
take
a
taxi
back
to
the
club
,
the
driver
tells
me
that
the
Indians
will
be
getting
it
in
the
neck
soon
.
They
are
to
blame
for
the
misery
and
squalor
.
Here
in
the
club
,
gardening
is
still
practised
with
religious
intensity
.
In
the
Third
World
gardening
is
absurd
.
Why
grow
things
you
ca
n't
eat
?
Why
water
luxuriant
canna
lilies
and
fast-flowering
,
even
faster-fading
,
roses
,
trained
on
ropes
to
make
living
swags
around
the
croquet
lawn
?
Why
trim
the
grass
so
short
that
not
even
a
goat
could
get
its
incisors
into
the
chlorophyl
?
Why
spend
money
on
fertilizers
and
ant
poisons
and
petrol
for
the
mowers
and
whitewash
for
the
tennis
court
-
and
incidentally
any
stray
rocks
that
need
it
-
and
why
build
great
steaming
compost
heaps
of
the
by-products
of
the
above
?
The
answer
is
that
gardens
re-create
a
corner
of
paradise
.
For
a
Masai
,
paradise
is
a
vast
savannah
,
dotted
with
beautifully
marked
and
horned
cattle
.
For
a
westerner
entering
this
harsh
,
insected
and
vipered
landscape
,
a
small
sanctuary
of
parterres
and
walkways
and
pergolas
and
gravelled
paths
and
granite
crazy
paving
,
was
evidence
of
faith
.
As
the
town
began
to
grow
and
at
the
same
time
fragment
in
strange
,
squalid
and
unforeseen
ways
,
the
gardens
became
symbolic
in
a
different
fashion
.
This
garden
(
protected
from
the
road
on
one
side
by
huge
,
untidy
gum
trees
,
in
a
permanent
state
of
reptilian
slough
,
leaving
the
discarded
bark
hanging
from
the
newly
emerged
,
silvery
trunks
)
has
for
me
so
powerful
a
charm
because
it
returns
me
to
my
childhood
,
with
a
complete
collection
of
odours
,
insects
,
fragrances
,
ponds
and
over-vigorous
plants
.
But
there
is
more
to
it
.
The
texture
of
the
sounds
,
the
little
ant-bear
funnels
,
the
twittering
of
the
water
sprinklers
,
the
unnamed
but
instantly
familiar
birds
,
the
patient
devotions
of
the
gardeners
,
the
numberless
frogs
(
now
in
caviare-eyed
repose
on
water
lilies
and
ledges
)
,
the
huge
,
lazy
tadpoles
,
the
dragonflies
on
their
biplane
wings
skimming
the
water
,
the
busy
red
ants
returning
with
baguettes
of
grass
(
the
same
ants
which
used
to
run
up
the
shorts
of
children
and
sink
their
vicious
fangs
into
unwary
little
scrota
)
and
now
the
distant
thwack
of
tennis
bails
and
the
inevitable
muted
cries
of
anguish
-
all
these
impressions
play
so
strongly
on
my
memory
because
they
leap
thirty-five
years
of
my
life
in
one
bound
.
It
's
pleasurable
and
it
's
surprising
in
its
detail
.
The
question
is
,
what
on
earth
does
it
mean
?
Why
are
these
memories
so
strong
and
so
personal
?
I
am
sitting
now
in
an
arbour
of
rust-coloured
bougainvillaea
drinking
lukewarm
,
weak
coffee
,
brought
to
me
in
a
stainless
steel
pot
by
a
waiter
in
a
starched
white
uniform
,
thinking
in
an
aimless
way
about
this
puzzle
,
when
I
see
the
waiter
returning
.
He
is
holding
a
round
copper
tray
under
one
arm
like
a
subaltern
with
his
cap
at
a
passing-out
parade
.

Telephone

I
walk
up
to
the
main
building
along
a
path
of
large
brown
stones
with
the
shape

texture
of
unleavened

.
Within
their
surfaces
are
tiny

This
is
book
to
me
-
of
which
the
clubhouse
is
built
and
which
the
early
settlers
favoured
in
their
pursuit
of
the
substantial
.
Taking
a
long-distance
call
still
causes
a
certain
turbulence
here
.
I
am
ushered
reverently
into
a
cabin
and
pick
up
the
quaint
hand
set
,
which
has
an
additional
round
earpiece
for
clamping
over
the
spare
ear
,
so
that
I
see
myself
reflected
in
the
glass
like
a
radio
operator
or
a
session
singer
.
The
call
fills
me
with
apprehension
.
Over
the
airwaves
and
under
the
sea
,
or
however
his
quavering

reaches
me
from

The
truth
is
,
I
do
n't
feel
elated
.
I
wander
back
out
to
the
garden
,
but
the
magic
has
gone
.
The
professor
's
secretary
,
who
is
wearing
fluffy
aquamarine
slippers
,
asks
me
to
wait
at
the
end
of
a
blank
corridor
.
After
a
few
moments
the
professor
himself
appears
from
a
doorway
.
Northern
European
faces
do
n't
necessarily
age
well
.
The
early
freshness
,
the
attractive
blondness
,
the
amiable
,
even
features
can
become
anonymous
as
the
hair
thins
and
the
face
subsides
into
middle
age
.
Like
a
bust
of
a
minor
general
in
a
park
,
his
weathered
face
has
no
edges
.
His
hair
,
similarly
,
has
collapsed
onto
his
head
so
that
at
first
-
I
see
him
at
the
end
of
a
corridor
-
he
appears
to
be
completely
bald
.
He
has
very
fine
hair
,
resting
timidly
and
lifelessly
on
his
skull
.
He
is
a
man
of
about
fifty-five
,
with
a
quick
"
nervous
manner
,
as
if
he
had
pressing
engagements
elsewhere
,
which
seems
unlikely
:
the
university
has
run
out
of
steam
and
its
faculty
members
are
all
jumping
ship
,
if
they
can
.
Uitsmijter
has
made
a
study
of
Maa
.
He
holds
his
translation
of
the
laibon
's
monologue
.
It
is
on
curious
shiny
fax
paper
.
He
hands
me
the
manuscript
,
about
fifteen
pages
.
I
hand
him
the
agreed
fee
,
in
dollars
,
and
for
a
moment
we
are
suspended
,
directionless
,
outside
his
office
.
The
transaction
seems
to
embarrass
him
because
he
insists
on
carrying
it
out
in
the
corridor
out
of
sight
of
his
secretary
,
whose
fluffy
blue
feet
have
just
slipped
and
slid
back
through
the
door
of
his
office
.
I
wonder
what
this
casual
,
sexy
skating
along
the
linoleum
says
about
their
relationship
.
"
Is
it
interesting
to
you
,
as
a
scholar
,
I
mean
?
"
He
speaks
English
in
a
curious
way
,
that
improbable
Dutch-accent
tongue
slapping
down
hard
on
the
vowels
,
like
shoe
leather
on
a
dry
pavement
.
He
has
also
adopted
African
pronunciations
of
some
words
,
with
a
savouring
of
random
vowels
.
"
What
you
have
here
is
a
traditional
account
of
Masai
origins
,
but
also
mixed
with
the
arrival
of
this
woman
-
I
am
assuming
,
although
it
is
not
my
business
,
the
ethnographer
,
Claude
Cohn-Casson
-
yes
,
okay
,
well
,
there
was
an
incident
during
the
war
,
a
famous
incident
as
far
as
the
Masai
is
concerned
,
when
a
British
official
was
killed
in
a
very
small
dispute
about
cattle
.
Your
man
,
Saibol
ole
Saitoti
,
is
linking
this
incident
to
Mademoiselle
Cohn-Casson
.
He
also
refers
to
Fairfax
,
he
means
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
who
is
still
alive
,
you
know
,
who
was
a
friend
of
Mademoiselle
Cohn-Casson
.
I
find
it
very
interesting
that
your
laibon
knew
Fairfax
.
"
The
rest
,
I
must
say
,
is
confusing
but
very
interesting
for
me
.
Saibol
speaks
Maa
in
a
way
which
tells
me
that
he
comes
from
the
Kisongo
of
the
Ol
Doinyo
Lengai
,
yes
?
Yes
,
good
.
He
makes
some
allegations
which
I
ca
n't
understand
.
I
have
tried
to
translate
them
for
you
.
Mostly
he
is
talking
about
a
period
before
the
war
but
he
also
refers
to
the
uprising
against
the
Germans
in
1912
,
and
some
events
immediately
after
the
last
war
,
and
to
a
man
he
describes
as
his
brother
.
Wait
a
minute
,
I
have
almost
nearly
forgot
your
tape
.
"
The
social
sciences
building
is
free
of
students
.
The
pro-democracy
rallies
and
protests
at
the
rigged
elections
have
led
to
government
disappointment
with
the
behaviour
of
the
students
.
The
university
has
been
under
curfew
and
restraint
for
months
.
The
anti-democratic
movement
,
which
calls
itself
the
anti-tribal
movement
,
is
considering
widening
the
net
in
its
search
for
suitable
replacement
students
.
People
without
any
education
at
all
seem
to
offer
the
best
hope
.
Uitsmijter
returns
with
my
tape
.
"
You
should
go
now
.
You
wo
n't
find
in
Masai
stories
linear
logic
.
You
have
to
understand
that
the
whole
linguistic
system
of
signs
,
signifiers
-
are
you
familiar
with
linguistics
?
well
,
I
do
n't
blame
you
-
all
these
are
different
.
It
's
not
what
you
would
say
was
logical
but
it
is
very
complex
.
The
old
settlers
thought
the
Masai
were
liars
.
So
,
if
I
can
help
you
again
,
please
tell
me
.
Goodbye
.
"
He
pauses
briefly
to
watch
me
leave
.
I
look
round
as
I
reach
a
junction
in
the
corridor
and
he
quickly
pops
back
into
his
office
.
I
wonder
if
his
jumpiness
is
a
result
of
the
university
's
troubles
or
sexual
intrigues
,
which
can
wreak
havoc
among
the
middle-aged
.
I
walk
through
a
cut-price
version
of
the
groves
of
academe
,
a
concrete
path
overhung
by
jacaranda
trees
,
set
in
a
termite-ravaged
lawn
.
In
his
desire
to
make
sure
that
I
do
justice
to
the
Masai
cosmic
vision
,
the
professor
overestimates
my
attachment
to
the
logical
.
The
club
is
very
quiet
.
There
is
a
period
of
what
seems
to
be
enforced
idleness
in
the
afternoon
.
It
reminds
me
of
provincial
France
,
where
you
can
drive
through
a
village
on
a
summer
's
afternoon
and
wonder
if
the
place
is
inhabited
.
No
tennis
ball
thwacking
.
No
lawn
mowing
.
No
clatter
from
the
kitchen
.
Only
the
drugged
flies
lumbering
and
buzzing
through
the
air
and
the
idiot
,
eager
frogs
bellowing
recognize
no
siesta
.
I
pull
back
the
candlewick
bedspread
and
lie
on
my
back
with
my
manuscript
.
The
laibon
kicks
off
with
a
creation
myth
.
The
first
man
,
Kintu
,
visited
the
sky
where
God
,
Ngai
,
lives
and
was
given
God
's
go-ahead
to
create
the
Masai
people
.
(
I
had
been
led
to
believe
that
God
lived
in
Ol
Doinyo
Lengai
.
Perhaps
he
claims
the
airspace
above
as
well
.
)
From
Kintu
sprang
all
the
Masai
,
whose
life
was
to
be
a
great
odyssey
.
The
Masai
were
expressly
charged
by
God
with
responsibility
for
the
world
's
cattle
.
Cattle
,
says
the
laibon
,
must
be
praised
.
Every
Masai
thinks
constantly
about
cattle
.
Every
Masai
sings
hymns
to
cattle
.
The
world
is
framed
in
the
image
of
cattle
.
(
My
words
,
not
his
.
)
This
is
the
Masai
's
special
task
on
earth
.
There
is
no
contradiction
-
as
Claudia
pointed
out
in
her
thesis
-
between
this
task
and
the
fact
that
other
tribes
have
cattle
:
other
tribes
have
stolen
them
.
They
are
not
entitled
to
them
.
These
other
tribes
were
ordained
by
Ngai
to
be
farmers
,
wretched
people
obliged
to
scratch
the
soil
,
just
as
the
Ndorrobo
were
specifically
entrusted
by
Ngai
to
produce
what
the
Masai
need
-
spears
,
shields
and
useful
vessels
.
The
Ndorrobo
were
not
allowed
to
own
cattle
so
they
had
to
hunt
the
unappetizing
wild
game
,
something
a
Masai
would
never
do
.
Many
white
people
,
says
the
laibon
,
did
not
understand
God
's
commandments
and
tried
to
change
things
.
(
You
do
n't
need
to
be
a
trained
anthropologist
to
spot
the
seeds
of
conflict
in
this
theology
.
)
And
now
the
fat
bellies
in
the
cities
are
carrying
on
where
the
white
folk
left
off
.
(
I
can
picture
the
laibon
as
he
told
me
this
,
his
son
sitting
behind
him
on
a
rock
flossing
his
teeth
.
)
The
Masai
moved
from
the
great
river
of
the
north
,
freely
interpreted
as
the
Nile
,
says
the
professor
in
a
note
,
down
towards
their
present
location
.
It
was
a
terrible
journey
reducing
the
Masai
nation
to
a
few
hundred
survivors
.
(
Our
own
time
provides
the
television
simulacra
of
this
march
in
Somalia
and
Ethiopia
.
)
The
march
took
many
years
,
perhaps
more
than
a
century
.
Time
in
those
days
lacked
urgency
or
precision
.
But
the
plains
,
savannahs
,
rivers
and
hills
,
all
the
way
from
Samburu
down
to
the
Masai
Steppe
,
proved
fruitful
and
the
Masai
built
up
their
strength
through
the
acquisition
of
women
and
cattle
so
successfully
that
they
chased
out
the
other
tribes
who
were
obliged
to
cling
to
the
mountains
or
secrete
themselves
in
the
forests
,
land
useless
for
cattle
.
When
the
white
man
came
(
what
a
familiar
and
mournful
phrase
)
they
were
not
allowed
the
same
freedom
to
repossess
their
cattle
.
It
became
a
crime
,
punishable
by
lashes
under
the
Germans
and
by
fines
under
the
British
,
to
take
the
cattle
of
other
tribes
.
This
was
a
gross
injustice
.
The
laibon
speaks
of
the
Masai
uprising
against
the
Germans
in
1915
and
of
the
last
great
war
waged
against
the
unspeakable
Bantu
tribes
around
Lake
Victoria
who
ate
fish
.
The
warriors
,
in
those
days
,
he
says
,
preferred
to
die
rather
than
return
home
without
dipping
their
spears
in
blood
.
Warriors
now
know
nothing
of
war
and
cattle
raiding
.
They
are
similarly
ill-equipped
to
deal
with
lions
.
Some
poison
lions
which
are
troublesome
,
rather
than
kill
them
with
a
spear
.
It
is
a
shameful
thing
.
Now
the
Masai
are
torn
by
the
need
to
go
to
school
(
schule
in
Swahili
,
a
leftover
of
German
occupation
)
and
the
understanding
that
young
people
who
go
to
school
are
lost
to
the
traditional
ways
.
Women
are
particularly
vulnerable
to
the
false
promises
of
city
slickers
.
(
I
think
here
of
Victoria
.
)
After
a
short
discourse
about
women
-
the
need
for
the
dowry
of
five
animals
and
three
useful
articles
to
be
maintained
,
even
for
schoolgirls
-
he
speaks
of
Claudia
.
She
came
to
live
among
them
.
His
father
was
the
laibon
at
the
time
and
he
had
five
brothers
.
His
father
wore
a
cloak
of
hyrax
skins
which
he
received
along
with
other
tools
of
the
trade
-
pebbles
,
containers
and
more
important
,
the
ability
to
use
numbers
to
foretell
the
future
.
He
is
descended
directly
from
Kidongoi
,
the
first
laibon
,
who
was
given
supernatural
powers
on
the
mountain
by
Ngai
.
(
Although
the
tablets
have
been
transmuted
into
handier
,
pocket-sized
pebbles
,
the
kinship
with
Moses
seems
too
close
to
be
a
coincidence
.
)
As
I
read
,
I
am
struck
again
by
the
laibon
's
sense
of
being
at
the
centre
of
the
universe
.
He
lives
near
the
mountain
of
God
,
in
the
Rift
Valley
in
a
paradise
of
rivers
,
lakes
,
mountains
and
plains
.
People
who
come
from
the
outside
world
inhabit
the
periphery
,
where
they
have
no
cattle
and
live
an
inferior
life
.
Claudia
came
from
that
world
.
At
first
,
he
says
,
people
did
not
understand
what
she
wanted
,
but
she
came
to
learn
about
the
Masai
and
write
it
in
a
book
.
She
wanted
to
attend
the
eunoto
and
the
women
's
circumcision
and
understand
everything
about
betrothals
.
She
soon
knew
all
there
is
to
know
,
more
than
many
Masai
men
,
about
the
exchange
of
gifts
,
cattle
and
goats
which
always
accompanies
these
ceremonies
.
At
first
people
were
suspicious
;
they
could
not
understand
why
she
was
so
interested
in
these
details
,
which
she
wrote
down
in
a
schoolbook
.
Soon
she
could
speak
Maa
.
One
day
she
brought
a
voice
box
.

Uitsmijter

I
am
struck
by
anxiety
.
How
quickly
can
one
learn
a
language
?
My
Swahili
,
such
as
it
is
,
comes
from
a
Berlitz
tape
and
a
phrase
book
.
In
Claudia
's
time
very
few
Masai
spoke
Swahili
.
As
I
get
older
I
find
myself
tormented
by
anxieties
of
this
nature
,
the
anxieties
about
things
one
will
never
do
.
They
are
the
anxieties
of
our
times
,
born
of
the
idea
that
the
individual
must
in
one
way
or
another
(
any
damned
way
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
even
confessing
to
having
been
abused
as
a
child
)
express
his
uniqueness
and
fulfil
his
potential
.
Durkheim
,
Claudia
's
inspiration
,
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
that
the
problem
for
twentieth-century
western
man
was
the
anomie
created
by
the
breakdown
of
the
old
certainties
.
What
he
could
not
see
was
the
restless
,
self-centred
consumerism
it
would
produce
.
Nor
did
he
see
another
consequence
,
as
his
nephew
Mauss
confessed
,
shortly
before
going
mad
:
"
how
large
modern
societies
which
have
more
or
less
emerged
from
the
Middle
Ages
in
other
respects
,
could
be
hypnotized
as
aborigines
are
by
their
dances
and
set
in
motion
like
a
child
's
carousel
.
This
return
to
the
primitive
had
not
been
the
object
of
our
thoughts
.
"
The
club
is
quiet
.
The
gardens
outside
my
window
are
bowing
down
to
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
,
but
my
mind
is
racing
in
this
stillness
,
like
a
dust
devil
on
the
apparently
windless
plains
.
I
see
myself
drawing
closer
to
Claudia
Cohn-Casson
,
but
not
necessarily
in
the
way
that
S.
O.
Letterman
is
expecting
of
me
.
The
club
and
Fairfax
and
Lady
De
Marr
and
now
the
laibon
's
tale
,
seem
to
me
to
have
pulled
us
together
.
It
's
absurd
,
but
I
feel
we
are
all
protagonists
now
in
the
same
story
.
I
have
heard
her
voice
and
spoken
to
her
lover
and
been
walking
with
the
Masai
who
was
present
at
the
farcical
and
tragic
lion
hunt
.
I
no
longer
believe
that
I
am
just
writing
a
treatment
of
her
life
.
I
feel
as
if
I
am
poised
somewhere
on
the
edge
of
a
slope
,
and
about
to
slide
down
when
I
am
supposed
to
be
climbing
up
.
It
's
crazy
,
but
I
feel
as
though
I
have
no
life
outside
this
one
I
have
found
here
,
complete
with
silly
old
colonials
and
Masai
witch-doctor
.
I
have
n't
thought
of
Victoria
,
whose
sexual
peccadilloes
gave
me
such
pain
,
for
days
.
Yet
even
as
I
remember
Victoria
,
I
feel
keenly
the
unsettled
state
of
my
mind
.
How
could
I
possibly
have
neglected
to
think
about
her
when
a
few
weeks
ago
I
could
think
of
little
else
,
in
lubricious
detail
?
I
find
myself
instead
picturing
Claudia
,
her
dark
eyes
turned
to
the
sky
.
I
see
her
crouching
at
the
entrance
of
a
hut
(
olpal
)
looking
in
at
,
perhaps
talking
to
,
the
shy
bride
within
,
who
does
not
want
to
leave
her
father
's
village
(
engang
)
.
I
find
myself
attempting
to
memorize
the
Masai
words
as
she
did
.
I
see
her
walking
with
the
bride
to
her
new
village
,
being
teased
by
the
escort
of
girls
.
I
see
her
,
as
she
described
,
catching
sight
of
the
husband
's
village
.
And
I
imagine
these
same
dark
eyes
catching
sight
of
the
five
chimneys
of
Auschwitz-Birkenau
.
The
laibon
now
talks
about
the
famous
incident
when
a
district
officer
was
killed
.
The
British
had
insisted
that
the
Masai
sell
some
cattle
to
pay
for
schools
and
clinics
and
-
there
was
clearly
a
hint
of
blackmail
-
to
contribute
to
the
war
effort
.
Many
Masai
resisted
this
tax
,
but
they
had
no
choice
.
The
laibon
says
that
his
father
saw
the
sense
in
it
.
He
did
n't
want
the
Germans
back
.
A
young
man
called
Tepilit
ole
paramat
,
the
laibon
's
brother
,
tried
at
the
last
minute
to
withdraw
one
of
his
cattle
from
the
sale
.
The
district
officer
in
charge
,
known
to
the
Masai
as
Tombol
(
Miles
Turnbull
)
refused
to
allow
the
animal
to
be
withdrawn
and
ordered
his
askaris
to
restrain
Tepilit
.
In
the
presence
of
a
few
hundred
Masai
,
the
young
warrior
hurled
his
spear
right
through
the
district
officer
's
heart
.
The
blade
appeared
out
of
his
back
.
Watched
by
the
crowd
,
Tepilit
withdrew
his
spear
and
walked
away
.
He
was
eventually
arrested
.
He
did
not
hide
and
he
said
that
he
would
do
the
same
again
.
The
bull
in
question
had
markings
of
which
he
was
particularly
proud
.
He
had
offered
an
alternative
.
The
laibon
says
that
his
family
had
offered
forty-nine
cattle
in
restitution
,
but
the
British
took
Tepilit
to
the
coast
and
hanged
him
there
.
What
was
achieved
by
that
?
However
,
some
members
of
his
family
were
glad
,
because
it
meant
they
did
not
have
to
produce
cattle
.
Uitsmijter
in
a
note
says
that
the
Masai
have
a
system
of
fines
,
multiples
of
seven
.
Forty-nine
cattle
is
the
highest
possible
penalty
.
The
young
man
who
was
hanged
was
a
special
friend
of
Claudia
.
He
wanted
to
marry
her
.
Fairfax
-
Fahfakhs
-
who
was
a
big
man
in
the
government
had
come
down
to
the
little
town
where
Tepilit
was
held
.
Fahfakhs
was
wearing
a
uniform
.
He
and
Claudia
spent
a
long
time
talking
to
the
police
and
to
the
accused
man
.
He
,
the
laibon
,
had
heard
Fahfakhs
shouting
at
the
accused
man
in
the
cells
at
Ewaso
Narok
police
post
before
he
was
taken
to
the
coast
.
(
Fahfakhs
spoke
fluent
Maa
.
)
The
laibon
's
father
had
explained
to
Fahfakhs
that
the
family
was
ready
to
pay
compensation
,
up
to
the
full
amount
possible
.
He
had
told
Fahfakhs
that
the
young
man
wanted
to
marry
Claudia
,
and
perhaps
he
thought
that
the
district
officer
was
laughing
at
him
and
treating
him
with
contempt
.
Tepilit
had
asked
Claudia
in
the
proper
way
,
to
see
if
her
father
,
wherever
his
village
was
,
would
accept
gifts
.
He
had
given
Claudia
a
necklace
to
wear
in
the
meanwhile
and
called
her
pakiteng
.
(
Uitsmijter
explains
that
it
is
an
affectionate
name
meaning
"
heifer
"
used
by
betrothed
people
.
)
The
laibon
still
could
not
understand
the
point
of
hanging
such
a
man
.
The
district
officer
's
family
got
no
cattle
out
of
it
either
.
Fahfakhs
explained
that
Native
Law
did
not
cover
this
case
.
He
had
told
Fahfakhs
that
Tepilit
had
actually
killed
a
lion
for
the
film
that
Claudia
was
making
with
Leavitt
,
whose
name
I
had
reminded
him
of
.
Tepilit
had
risked
his
life
for
Claudia
.
Two
morans
had
been
killed
,
and
still
Leavitt
had
not
produced
the
promised
cattle
.
After
Tepilit
was
taken
away
to
be
tried
,
they
never
saw
him
again
.
Soon
afterwards
Claudia
said
she
was
leaving
.
Some
said
that
she
was
going
to
be
the
wife
of
Fahfakhs
.
Many
people
were
very
sad
to
see
her
go
.
He
,
the
laibon
,
was
not
so
sad
because
he
believed
that
she
had
caused
many
upsets
.
But
she
spoke
to
them
all
and
said
she
would
never
forget
them
.
She
was
going
back
to
her
father
's
house
to
show
people
what
she
had
written
in
her
schoolbooks
about
them
.
She
would
come
back
as
soon
as
she
could
.
She
was
leaving
their
country
with
a
heavy
heart
.
Professor
Uitsmijter
has
quite
a
deft
touch
in
translation
.
I
find
myself
able
to
place
the
words
,
in
all
their
moving
directness
,
right
into
the
laibon
's
mouth
as
he
spoke
,
with
Ol
Doinyo
Lengai
away
in
the
distance
looking
like
a
steamed
pudding
,
its
runnelled
slopes
lightly
coated
with
cream
,
poured
from
above
but
vitrified
before
reaching
the
base
.
Some
time
later
they
heard
that
Tepilit
had
been
hanged
.
After
the
war
was
over
they
heard
that
Claudia
had
died
.
How
had
she
died
?
He
would
like
to
know
what
happened
to
Claudia
and
her
books
.
Nobody
had
ever
told
him
.
If
I
knew
,
would
I
tell
him
?
Did
she
marry
Fahfakhs
?

And
so

monologue
complete

we
had
set
off

The
thin
paper
in

hand
flutters

I
drop
it

onset

After
they
hit
the
racquet
they
make
another
,
more
resonant
sound
,
as
they
bounce
on
the
ant
soil
surface

a
sound
you
can
hear
on
television
when
tennis
is
played
at

There
is
no
sign

eat
alone
in

dining
room
and
the
next
morning
set
off
early
back
to
Mr
Shah
's
hotel

The
journey
takes
seven
hours

As

there
is
chicken
lolling

the
metal
trays

Leon
Cohn-Casson
had
believed
that
the
sooner
all
Jews
lost
any
traces
of
separate
identity
the
better
.
He
agreed
with
Emile
Durkheim
that
Jewish
ethnicity
would
wane
with
the
advance
of
secular
society
.
The
only
way
forward
was
on
these
secular
,
scientific
principles
.
Sociology
and
anthropology
were
the
application
of
these
principles
to
understanding
how
people
behave
.
For
this
reason
he
had
encouraged
Claudia
to
enter
these
new
,
modern
sciences
.
He
had
cultivated
Marcel
Mauss
,
Durkheim
's
nephew
,
so
that
he
could
personally
convey
to
her
the
importance
of
understanding
the
springs
of
human
action
.
Mauss
had
come
to
their
house
in
the
avenue
Hoche
for
dinner
;
like
most
academics
-
I
am
guessing
-
feeling
a
little
shabby
when
confronted
by
the
glowing
paintings
and
rich
Aubussons
and
complex
dinner
settings
.
Claudia
wrote
about
his
quiet
passion
.
He
could
pluck
examples
of
the
universal
spirit
from
any
number
of
societies
he
had
studied
.
What
a
queasy
period
those
inter-war
years
now
seem
(
I
am
looking
at
the
chicken
curry
)
,
the
old
hatreds
and
prejudices
simmering
and
bubbling
nicely
with
all
the
dark
,
irrational
fears
surfacing
in
a
way
that
rational
people
like
Cohn-Casson
believed
had
long
ago
been
rendered
obsolete
by
the
evolutionary
nature
of
society
.
The
modern
order
,
because
it
was
based
on
industry
,
would
produce
a
rational
society
.
What
a
delusion
.
Cohn-Casson
was
born
in
1882
,
not
long
after
France
's
humiliation
by
the
prussians
.
He
had
spent
his
life
,
as
many
of
the
French
intelligentsia
had
,
looking
for
a
basis
for
order
in
society
.
France
is
a
country
which
has
grave
doubts
about
its
moral
fibre
;
it
sees
its
national
character
as
being
as
permeable
as
a
colander
.
It
was
for
this
reason
that
Leon
Cohn-Casson
became
such
a
fervent
advocate
of
a
secular
morality
.
He
disliked
the
arriviste
Jews
because
he
felt
that
they
were
provincial
and
superstitious
and
liable
to
arouse
hostility
;
nor
did
he
believe
that
they
would
be
loyal
to
France
.
But
Cohn-Casson
also
found
it
impossible
to
side
uncritically
with
Jews
,
because
to
do
so
would
deny
modern
thinking
,
by
placing
tribal
loyalties
above
the
mandates
of
science
.
Leon
Blum
,
the
new
prime
Minister
,
said
of
people
like
Cohn-Casson
:
"
They
secretly
curse
those
who
put
them
in
the
hands
of
secular
enemies

This
is
one
of
Letterman
's
aphorisms
.
He
has
a
number
,
many
quite
apt
,
which
he
is
liable
to
produce
to
lend
substance
to
his
conversation
.
His
conversation
is
a
finely
wrought
sales
pitch
.
He
is
selling
himself
.
It
has
been
his
life
's
work
.
The
events
of
his
life
are
constantly
incorporated
into
this
spiel
.
For
example
,
he
has
been
married
and
is
still
on
very
good
terms
with
his
wife
;
their
divorce
unlocked
her
true
potential
,
and
she
is
now
a
part-time
feminist
studies
lecturer
at
SCU
.
Letterman
implies
that
he
had
to
divorce
her
for
her
own
good
;
he
could
not
bear
to
see
so
much
life
force
confined
in
marriage
.
Their
son
Dylan
,
who
is
twelve
,
lives
with
her
but
there
are
no
custody
conflicts
and
they
have
a
wonderful
rapport
.
Dylan
helps
him
see
things
in
an
honest
fashion
,
without
all
the
crap
.
This
is
the
philosophical
side
.
On
the
poetic
side
,
he
has
had
many
good
relationships
with
women
.
He
thinks
that
he
has
a
part
of
his
nature
which
is
more
in
harmony
with
women
than
men
.
He
sees
himself
as
having
an
intuitive
,
feminine
aspect
.
Although
he
mentions
it
to
me
,
he
finds
he
is
unable
to
display
this
aspect
to
men
.
It
only
comes
out
in
his
dealings
with
women
.
Personally
I
think
this
is
another
of
his
sales
pitches
.
I
walk
up
the
track
past
the
fundamentalist
missions
,
way
above
the
coffee
plantations
,
up
into
what
is
nominally
a
wildlife
reserve
.
I
am
proposing
to
ponder
the
question
of
Letterman
's
script
up
in
the
higher
altitudes
.
A
sign
reads
"
Crater
Reserve
,
please
Stay
in
Your
Vehicle
.
"
This
sign
has
been
painted
on
a
piece
of
board
and
is
listing
badly
.
Some
small
boys
come
down
the
track
towards
me
.
They
are
laughing
and
chasing
each
other
.
When
they
see
me
they
become
strangely
still
and
respectful
.
They
probably
think
that
,
like
most
of
the
white
men
in
this
evangelical
belt
between
the
coffee
plantations
and
the
colobus
monkey
habitat
,
I
have
religious
connections
and
perhaps
even
powers
,
the
sort
of
powers
that
cause
money
to
come
to
pass
.
This
is
the
white
man
's
greatest
achievement
:
he
has
learned
how
to
get
his
mitts
on
the
money
.
(
There
is
another
argument
,
nowadays
timidly
advanced
only
by
a
few
academics
of
the
old
hair-shirt
tendency
,
that
the
white
man
has
fixed
the
game
,
making
it
almost
impossible
for
the
others
to
get
in
.
)
The
connection
between
religion
and
wealth
is
clear
:
the
religious
people
have
almost
as
many
vehicles
,
servants
and
supplies
of
electrical
goods
as
the
aid
community
.
I
give
these
children
my
benediction
.
It
is
delivered
in
the
form
of
a
few
coins
which
bear
the
likeness
of
the
last
president
,
a
pleasant
utopian
who
retired
of
his
own
free
will
.
The
children
,
their
faith
reinforced
,
run
down
the
hill
to
tell
others
of
their
good
fortune
as
I
stride
up
the
track
towards
the
forest
.
The
forest
is
cool
.
I
ask
myself
why
the
people
do
n't
live
up
here
in
these
glades
beside
the
rushing
streams
.
Life
would
be
so
much
more
leafy
.
It
would
be
almost
European
.
At
a
great
height
I
catch
sight
of
a
colobus
.
These
monkeys
are
used
in
the
manufacture
of
household
articles
and
headdresses
by
ail
the
tribes
in
whose
domain
they
are
found
.
This
is
the
sort
of
relationship
between
man
and
animal
which
westerners
find
hard
to
accept
:
the
use
of
a
monkey
as
a
fly-swat
.
In
my
excited
state
,
as
the
trees
close
over
my
head
,
I
see
this
kind
of
thinking
,
this
desire
to
reshape
the
world
into
something
reassuring
,
as
having
many
applications
.
For
example
S.
O.
Letterman
sees
Claudia
's
story
as
a
vindication
of
the
human
spirit
,
to
which
,
professionally
anyway
,
he
pays
tribute
.
The
human
spirit
,
in
this
estimation
,
is
always
on
the
move
,
restlessly
upwards
like
climbers
on
K2
.
I
am
under
notice
to
find
a
suitably
uplifting
ending
for
our
movie
.
The
smoke
rising
from
the
five
chimneys
of
Auschwitz-Birkenau
is
a
downer
,
although
he
thinks
there
may
be
something
in
my
idea
of
complementary
smoke
rising
from
the
savannah
.
"
It
's
crazy
,
but
people
just
wo
n't
go
to
the
movies
if
the
thing
ends
on
a
downer
.
"
I
do
n't
argue
with
Letterman
.
Why
should
I
?
He
's
an
expert
on
popular
taste
.
He
sees
Claudia
as
brainy
,
beautiful
,
romantic
and
symbolic
.
The
last
part
of
the
proposition
still
needs
some
work
.
I
have
decided
to
broaden
my
idea
of
the
savannahs
with
smoke
rising
from
the
Masai
villages
.
I
see
the
camera
closing
to
find
her
old
Masai
friends
gathering
after
a
day
,
another
of
the
infinite
number
of
days
,
spent
caring
for
the
cattle
.
The
ex-hunter
,
aviator
and
war
hero
,
Tom
Fairfax
,
who
was
her
lover
,
is
approaching
in
his
biplane
.
First
his
small
plane
is
seen
searching
the
vast
plains
for
her
village
.
The
sky
is
reddening
,
reminding
the
viewer
of
the
ghastly
hues
of
the
night
sky
above
Auschwitz
when
the
ovens
were
working
at
full
capacity
.
Down
below
,
fires
are
being
lit
and
the
cattle
are
being
driven
gently
into
the
enclosures
of
thorn
bushes
.
Music
rises
on
the
soundtrack
.
Fairfax
's
plane
circles
once
and
then
comes
down
to
land
bumpily
on
a
piece
of
gazelle-inhabited
ground
.
The
warriors
come
loping
for
news
of
Claudia
.
Fairfax
climbs
from
the
plane
and
walks
,
surrounded
by
the
tall
warriors
,
across
the
darkening
savannah
to
the
laibon
's
manyatta
.
The
laibon
,
dressed
in
his
traditional
finery
,
a
cloak
of
fur
on
his
shoulders
and
carrying
a
thin
stick
,
walks
across
the
enclosure
,
now
thick
with
the
strangely
blotched
cattle
,
their
huge
horns
gently
meshing
and
unmeshing
,
to
greet
Fairfax
.
The
moment
is
prolonged
and
intensified
almost
unbearably
.
(
The
music
,
I
will
suggest
,
should
be
based
on
Masai
chanting
.
)
Anyway
,
this
music
rises
hauntingly
.
The
laibon
and
Fairfax
face
each
other
.
They
speak
in
Maa
,
but
with
subtitles
.
Fairfax
tells
them
that
Claudia
is
dead
.
There
is
a
throaty
murmur
,
a
sort
of
groan
.
The
laibon
asks
who
killed
her
.
Fairfax
says
she
was
killed
by
the
Germans
.
He
takes
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
,
a
letter
from
Claudia
smuggled
to
him
from
the
Drancy
camp
in
Paris
.
He
tells
them
that
Claudia
has
written
them
a
last
message
.
He
clears
his
throat
,
which
is
suddenly
somewhat
congested
,
and
reads
:
"
Whatever
happens
to
me
,
I
shall
always
be
thinking
of
you
and
hoping
that
you
will
have
green
grass
for
your
cattle
.
"
From
the
Masai
this
deeply
human
murmur
rises
again
.
Night
is
falling
.
Fairfax
stands
surrounded
by
warriors
with
their
spears
,
women
holding
their
children
,
cattle
and
goats
jostling
;
the
music
rises
.
The
subtitles
now
roil
over
this
scene
.
They
tell
the
audience
that
Claudia
Cohn-Casson
,
born
1912
,
is
believed
to
have
died
in
Auschwitz
on
or
about
20
April
1945
,
fifteen
days
before
Germany
surrendered
.
I
am
panting
now
.
The
air
is
thinning
.
There
is
nobody
in
the
forest
although
it
is
loud
with
calls
and
cries
.
A
small
antelope
races
away
into
the
bush
.
For
a
moment
before
it
separates
itself
from
its
surroundings
I
catch
a
glimpse
of
its
round
eyes
,
beautiful
but
stupid
,
taking
in
the
sight
of
a
forty-three-year-old
writer
wearing
shorts
and
a
faded
polo
shirt
,
his
face
somewhat
craggier
than
he
sees
it
in
his
mind
's
eye
,
his
waist
a
little
more
solid
and
his
eyes
bright
with
the
thoughts
he
is
generating
.
Almost
immediately
it
has
vanished
,
able
somehow
to
levee
and
jetee
through
the
undergrowth
without
a
sound
.
Further
away
I
hear
colobus
monkeys
again
,
crashing
about
like
drunks
after
a
party
,
but
all
I
see
is
branches
in
motion
semaphoring
their
passing
.
I
think
that
Letterman
will
go
for
my
new
ending
.
I
am
light-headed
,
perhaps
from
a
mild
attack
of
altitude
sickness
.
In
a
gap
in
the
trees
I
can
now
look
down
over
a
green
vegetable
pointillism
of
tree-tops
,
falling
away
down
to
the
town
.
It
takes
me
another
two
hours
to
reach
the
top
,
which
provides
a
view
down
into
the
crater
which
looks
,
from
this
height
,
like
a
small
,
almost
perfectly
oval
park
with
artfully
sited
clumps
of
trees
and
lakes
.
On
the
other
side
of
the
rim
I
can
see
way
over
the
savannah
in
the
direction
of
the
Mountain
of
God
,
which
is
reduced
in
size
so
that
I
ca
n't
be
sure
which
of
the
outcrops
on
the
horizon
it
is
.
From
below
,
in
the
Bible
belt
,
I
hear
hymn
singing
.
Victoria
is
thirty-two
now
.
She
is
wary
of
platitudes
and
would
never
use
the
magazine
phrase
"
biological
clock
"
but
,
like
Captain
Hook
,
she
is
prone
to
hearing
a
fateful
ticking
.
She
resents
being
prey
to
such
banal
anxieties
.
But
we
both
know
,
although
I
have
n't
said
it
,
that
the
consequence
of
her
unfaithfulness
is
that
I
have
been
able
to
take
the
high
ground
.
We
also
know
that
this
is
unfair
.
I
have
hardly
thought
of
her
for
at
least
a
week
;
I
am
free
of
the
little
stabs
of
pain
and
the
scudding
dark
clouds
which
had
a
habit
of
appearing
from
nowhere
,
uninvited
and
unexpected
.
I
now
see
the
whole
episode
(
do
I
know
everything
?
)
in
the
way
that
Victoria
paints
it
:
a
minor
sexual
frolic
which
,
without
the
mistimed
floral
tribute
,
would
have
meant
nothing
.
But
my
new
detachment
is
bad
news
for
Victoria
's
cause
.
As
all
lovers
know
,
the
other
's
unease
is
balm
for
the
soul
.
I
feel
guilty
about
having
engaged
her
for
weeks
in
close
and
auto-erotic
questioning
.
So
I
settle
down
to
write
her
a
letter
explaining
my
erratic
behaviour
.
I
am
proposing
to
dress
it
up
a
little
,
as
Joyce
did
to
his
Nora
,
as
a
symptom
of
high-mindedness
.
In
these
matters
,
high-mindedness
takes
a
holiday
:
Joyce
wanted
to
watch
Nora
crapping
.
I
write
to
her
with
my
window
open
to
catch
a
breeze
which
is
coming
from
over
the
plains
where
the
short
rains
are
expected
.
They
are
announced
by
atmospheric
restlessness
:
papers
in
the
street
below
suddenly
dance
and
the
trees
on
the
mountain
ripple
.
The
Masai
feel
the
air
,
hoping
that
the
rains
will
produce
nutritionally
supercharged
grass
,
which
will
return
to
their
cattle
the
smooth
,
lustrous
flanks
and
moist
eyes
which
they
love
.
Can
I
tell
Victoria
this
?
Can
I
explain
to
her
that
I
am
fully
in
sympathy
with
their
monomania
?
I
tell
her
of
my
travels
,
although
none
of
them
is
to
a
place
you
could
easily
find
on
a
map
,
and
of
the
people
I
have
met
.
I
then
reassure
her
that
I
have
forgiven
her
,
although
I
am
aware
that
the
word
"
forgiven
"
implies
that
I
have
absolution
in
my
gift
.
(
The
truth
is
I
do
n't
want
to
forgive
her
,
because
it
will
free
her
from
the
grappling
irons
I
have
on
her
.
Also
,
I
do
n't
want
to
forgive
her
because
it
will
suggest
that
I
have
settled
for
something
.
)
After
a
few
minutes
I
realize
this
letter
can
not
be
written
truthfully
.
Instead
I
write
half-truths
.
I
tell
her
of
my
trip
to
Nairobi
and
the
contacts
with
the
laibon
,
but
I
am
unable
to
explain
to
her
how
my
personal
relationship
with
the
subject
matter
is
developing
.
I
gaze
out
of
the
window
and
see
in
the
distance
a
flash
,
like
a
tourist
's
Instamatic
,
of
lightning
.
I
make
a
determined
effort
to
rummage
around
in
the
jumble
of
our
years
together
for
some
of
the
intensity
of
feeling
I
had
for
her
.
I
would
like
to
be
able
to
find
at
least
an
oddment
of
eroticism
.
But
I
can
only
retrieve
her
lips
,
those
lightly
ribbed
,
juicy
lips
,
studded
and
patterned
in
close-up
like
a
mulberry
or
a
raspberry
,
their
almost
leathery
texture
if
you
were
to
brush
them
with
your
fingertips
or
tongue
tip
(
that
snaky
little
organ
equipped
with
ideas
of
its
own
)
.
Nothing
else
.
Her
lips
,
like
a
Man
Ray
picture
or
a
New
Age
sunrise
,
straddle
the
horizon
of
my
imagination
.
All
our
conversations
-
we
have
been
great
talkers
-
have
now
been
dumped
to
join
the
countless
other
discarded
conversations
,
arguments
and
recriminations
.
There
must
be
some
evolutionary
purpose
to
this
constant
verbal
skirmishing
and
foraying
.
What
I
see
now
is
the
complete
futility
,
the
gross
over-production
,
the
immeasurable
waste
of
emotion
and
words
.
It
is
as
though
we
had
to
talk
in
order
to
reassure
ourselves
that
we
were
living
.
Maybe
it
is
radar
,
coming
back
to
confirm
the
solidity
of
objects
around
us
.
But
then
our
conversations
took
a
dive
into
the
murky
waters
of
sexuality
and
jealousy
.
I
am
glad
to
be
free
again
.
The
clouds
have
dropped
down
over
the
mountain
so
that
the
evangelicals
and
charismatics
on
the
first
contour
above
the
town
have
vanished
into
the
mist
.
With
their
invisibility
comes
silence
.
The
mist
has
doused
their
singing
.
I
try
to
write
but
we
have
run
out
of
words
.
We
expended
them
too
recklessly
.
The
ones
that
are
left
are
lifeless
.
Instead
,
I
find
myself
wondering
what
Tom
Fairfax
was
concealing
behind
the
seal
face
and
marine
eyebrows
.
Then
I
remember
the
unopened
letters
,
the
reminders
from
the
grey
and
fog-bound
north
.
They
are
in
a
drawer
of
the
flimsy
wardrobe
.
Reluctantly
,
first
examining
the
postmarks
at
length
for
clues
,
I
open
them
.
S.
O.
Letterman
's
office
sends
me
the
announcement
made
at
Cannes
of
the
imminent
Franco-American
production
of
the
moving
story
of
Claude
Cohn-Casson
,
to
be
called
Masai
Dreaming
.
I
am
credited
as
the
internationally
known
journalist
and
writer
.
Casting
is
in
hand
in
Paris
and
Los
Angeles
.
A
number
of
well-known
directors
have
expressed
an
interest
in
the
script
,
which
is
in
first
draft
.
My
bank
also
writes
about
maintenance
payments
.
I
leave
Victoria
's
letter
to
last
.
It
contains
a
doctor
's
certificate
,
declaring
her
free
of
HIV
.
There
is
no
question
,
you
can
be
ready
for
death
,
even
wish
it
to
hurry
up
.
Saibol
's
brother
,
Tepilit
,
was
ready
to
die
because
he
realized
that
he
would
never
get
justice
.
Claudia
pleaded
with
him
to
make
some
defence
.
Why
should
he
make
a
defence
?
He
had
done
nothing
wrong
.
The
cell
where
he
was
held
was
,
like
a
prison
cell
in
a
spaghetti
western
,
built
of
mud
.
The
bricks
were
formed
from
unleavened
mud
,
dug
from
the
shallows
of
a
nearby
stream
.
The
public
works
department
,
a
heroic
collection
of
people
with
strange
provincial
accents
and
manners
,
had
a
mould
into
which
the
mud
was
poured
and
then
pressed
from
above
.
The
roof
of
the
cells
was
made
of
corrugated
iron
,
imported
from
Birmingham
.
These
little
buildings
were
spreading
out
over
the
savannah
in
a
game
of
checkers
,
with
the
goal
of
linking
all
the
pieces
into
a
chain
of
sound
administration
.
The
building
programme
was
halted
during
the
war
with
the
scarcity
of
corrugated
iron
.
It
was
very
hot
under
the
tin
roof
,
Tepilit
sat
on
the
mud
floor
.
He
would
not
speak
to
Claudia
;
in
despair
she
sent
a
message
to
Tom
Fairfax
in
Nairobi
.
He
spoke
Maa
fluently
and
he
had
unrivalled
connections
.
As
women
do
,
she
probably
knew
that
she
had
made
an
impression
on
him
on
the
two
or
three
occasions
they
had
met
at
Muthaiga
.
Claudia
could
see
that
locking
up
a
Masai
for
a
crime
he
did
not
understand
was
cruel
and
inhuman
.
Also
,
her
relationship
with
the
accused
man
had
been
-
I
am
wondering
to
just
what
extent
-
quite
intimate
.
After
all
,
he
had
felt
able
to
call
her
"
heifer
"
(
pakiteng
)
.
Claudia
who
was
all
too
aware
of
what
was
happening
in
France
-
foreign
Jews
rounded
up
,
her
own
father
hopelessly
compromised
,
labour
camps
from
which
none
returned
-
wrote
urgently
to
Fairfax
to
come
and
get
this
man
out
of
jail
.
It
seemed
to
her
ridiculous
at
such
a
time
"
to
ask
this
man
to
make
a
defence
.
It
is
like
asking
a
Jew
to
apologize
for
being
a
Jew
.
"
What
Claudia
had
in
mind
was
some
colouring
of
the
evidence
so
that
the
district
officer
,
Miles
Turnbull
,
a
harassed
,
overworked
but
popular
man
,
who
was
dead
-
bien
entendu
-
could
be
seen
to
have
acted
rashly
in
asking
his
askaris
to
point
a
gun
at
Tepilit
,
which
Tepilit
naturally
interpreted
as
meaning
they
were
about
to
shoot
him
.
But
Tepilit
refused
to
accept
any
suggestions
that
he
had
not
killed
the
man
deliberately
.
Far
from
it
.
As
he
sat
on
the
mud
floor
of
his
cell
,
disdaining
the
bed
,
he
said
that
he
would
do
exactly
the
same
again
.
His
official
statement
,
which
bore
his
thumbprint
,
confirmed
this
.
Fairfax
,
who
was
wearing
his
army
uniform
,
soon
lost
patience
.
Despite
his
familiarity
with
the
Masai
,
he
found
Tepilit
's
obduracy
insulting
.
He
had
made
a
long
journey
,
borrowing
fuel
for
his
plane
.
It
could
all
be
resolved
quite
simply
.
After
a
few
months
in
jail
for
manslaughter
,
Tepilit
could
be
released
:
the
war
effort
encouraged
flexibility
.
But
Tepilit
could
not
follow
the
reasoning
.
Fairfax
was
a
farmer
,
a
hunter
and
a
figure
in
the
colony
's
legislature
.
He
had
been
to
Sandhurst
and
served
in
a
cavalry
regiment
before
going
to
Kenya
to
farm
.
Like
so
many
others
before
him
-
Blixen
,
Finch
Hatton
,
Berkeley
Cole
-
he
preferred
the
life
of
safari
.
At
the
start
of
the
war
he
had
taken
up
his
old
rank
of
captain
and
was
now
a
major
in
the
King
's
African
Rifles
.
He
was
dressed
in
that
uniform
with
its
fancy
red
flashes
when
he
came
to
Claudia
's
aid
.
They
became
lovers
.
Perhaps
she
had
known
it
would
happen
,
perhaps
he
had
answered
her
call
for
the
same
reason
.
For
about
six
weeks
before
she
set
off
for
France
,
the
long
way
via
Cape
Town
,
they
made
love
feverishly
.
In
the
meanwhile
Tepilit
was
transferred
to
Dar
Es
Salaam
and
hanged
in
the
Fort
one
morning
at
four
thirty
.
I
have
in
front
of
me
some
photographs
from
a
collection
of
settlers
'
memories
.
There
they
are
,
sitting
on
their
fast
horses
,
gathered
with
their
hounds
,
posing
next
to
dead
animals
,
picnicking
by
crocodile-inhabited
rivers
.
In
these
photographs
are
ghostly
presences
,
Masai
and
Kikuyu
and
other
tribespeople
.
Sometimes
they
are
blurred
because
,
not
being
part
of
the
composition
,
they
are
moving
,
carrying
the
sponge
cake
or
the
gun
case
or
the
canvas
water
bottle
.
At
other
times
-
included
in
the
composition
-
they
stand
rigidly
to
attention
,
hardly
breathing
,
their
faces
a
frozen
rictus
.
Fairfax
could
fit
into
any
of
those
photographs
seamlessly
.
(
In
fact
,
he
is
in
one
as
a
very
young
man
accompanying
the
prince
of
Wales
on
safari
.
)
Fairfax
looks
like
Walter
Cronkite
.
I
see
that
behind
the
bluff
little
moustache
and
the
liquid
,
fish-liver
eyes
-
in
my
photograph
the
eyes
are
turned
towards
the
prince
of
Wales
(
himself
a
rather
ghostly
figure
under
a
solar
helmet
)
-
shelters
another
presence
.
Perhaps
this
happens
to
us
ail
as
we
age
:
our
past
lives
detach
themselves
and
stand
to
one
side
hesitantly
,
hardly
believing
the
corporeal
links
to
a
former
self
.
The
records
show
that
Tepilit
was
hanged
on
18
March
1944
.
After
he
was
transported
by
train
to
Dar
Es
Salaam
nothing
more
was
heard
in
Masailand
until
the
official
notice
was
posted
in
the
district
commissioner
's
office
in
Ewaso
Narok
confirming
that
sentence
had
been
carried
out
.
This
news
was
passed
to
his
people
,
who
burned
his
few
possessions
and
redistributed
his
livestock
.
There
were
arguments
about
procedure
because
he
was
the
first
Masai
from
the
area
to
die
in
this
way
.
None
of
the
simple
rituals
could
be
observed
but
in
the
tradition
of
warriors
who
have
performed
brave
deeds
-
say
the
grabbing
of
the
tail
of
a
lion
before
spearing
it
-
Tepilit
was
remembered
and
spoken
of
.
It
was
also
widely
believed
that
he
would
have
become
the
laibon
after
his
father
's
death
.
The
day
of
the
death
of
the
white
man
is
still
a
big
item
in
the
folkloric
memory
.
It
is
this
which
the
laibon
,
his
brother
,
wishes
to
bring
to
my
attention
.
For
him
there
is
a
sense
of
unfinished
business
.
He
hopes
that
I
may
be
able
,
in
some
way
,
to
plug
the
gap
in
his
family
history
.
This
gap
is
still
letting
in
the
wind
;
he
can
not
see
distinct
segments
of
time
past
.
I
also
wonder
if
it
is
possible
to
close
the
account
.
Here
S.
O.
Letterman
and
I
are
at
odds
.
I
have
suggested
that
we
could
leave
the
story
open-ended
,
but
he
clearly
thinks
I
do
n't
understand
the
nature
of
movies
very
well
.
He
quotes
:
"
Movies
are
about
two
huge
faces
on
the
screen
coming
together
and
eventually
embracing
.
"
But
Letterman
has
sent
me
warm
approval
of
my
new
ending
.
He
likes
the
idea
of
the
universal
spirit
.
What
he
sees
is
not
what
Durkheim
had
in
mind
and
what
Claudia
was
trying
to
detect
.
Instead
he
sees
the
big
idea
of
this
movie
:
all
people
are
linked
by
the
universal
spirit
.
Claudia
,
we
suppose
,
died
in
Auschwitz
believing
in
it
.
He
suggests
we
emend
Claudia
's
last
message
,
delivered
by
Fairfax
to
the
Masai
,
to
include
the
words
"
the
universal
spirit
"
.
Fairfax
should
now
say
to
the
assembled
Masai
:
"
Whatever
happens
to
her
she
will
always
remember
that
it
was
the
Masai
who
showed
her
that
the
human
race
shares
one
,
universal
,
spirit
.
"
He
also
agrees
to
my
request
to
take
Fairfax
on
board
as
historical
adviser
and
fixes
a
meeting
in
London
in
a
few
weeks
to
review
progress
.
London
.
I
hear
the
chimes
striking
in
the
grey
sky
.
From
here
London
seems
to
be
a
menacing
,
alien
place
.
I
have
lived
there
for
fifteen
years
,
but
the
moment
I
leave
I
feel
it
closing
the
doors
on
me
with
indifference
.
In
London
Victoria
is
living
in
my
flat
,
driving
my
car
,
using
my
bank
accounts
,
washing
our
sheets
.
Nursing
her
resentments
.
Here
,
the
short
rains
have
disappointed
.
A
quick
curtain
of
water
fell
across
the
plains
but
by
the
end
of
the
day
they
were
as
dry
as
ever
.
Up
in
the
mountain
,
the
Bible
belt
was
drenched
and
from
my
window
I
can
see
the
river
running
strongly
as
a
result
.
The
car
washing
and
laundry
activities
have
had
to
move
some
way
up
the
bank
.
Mr
Shah
is
impressed
by
my
long
fax
from
Letterman
.
The
heading
"
Letterman
productions
,
Hollywood
,
London
,
paris
"
,
with
a
movie
camera
logo
,
seems
to
me
to
come
from
a
comic
book
,
but
it
obviously
reminds
Mr
Shah
of
his
brief
association
with
Ava
Gardner
,
Clark
Gable
and
John
Ford
.
I
ask
Mr
Shah
to
fax
Letterman
in
LA
and
Fairfax
at
Muthaiga
.
He
likes
these
contacts
with
the
more
substantial
world
and
happily
hurries
off
in
the
direction
of
his
stationery
shop
and
fax
bureau
,
where
I
know
he
will
encounter
many
difficulties
.
A
moment
later
he
comes
back
.
"

eight
hours

Okay

.
No

"
The
universal
spirit
is
quite
adaptable
,
even
protean
.
Claudia
's
thesis
on
the
exchange
of
gifts
attempts
to
confirm
the
presence
of
the
universal
spirit
at
work
in
the
Masai
.
But
she
is
very
aware
of
what
Marcel
Mauss
called
"
the
total
social
fact
"
.
She
does
n't
,
of
course
,
mention
it
,
but
as
a
researcher
living
among
the
Masai
she
must
have
become
part
of
the
total
social
fact
herself
.
By
allowing
Tepilit
to
engage
in
the
formalities
of
gift
exchange
,
she
may
have
been
able
to
observe
at
close
quarters
how
it
worked
,
but
she
was
also
entering
into
the
drama
.
Mauss
had
suggested
that
by
an
exhaustive
process
of
observation
and
recording
,
it
might
be
possible
to
establish
unchanging
laws
of
human
behaviour
.
But
,
he
warns
,
this
universal
spirit
,
which
his
uncle
,
Emile
Durkheim
,
had
airily
postulated
,
can
only
be
recognized
after
taking
into
account
psychological
,
religious
,
magical
and
pragmatic
factors
.
This
is
clearly
impossible
.
Only
a
professor
at
the
College
de
France
could
imagine
that
anyone
(
let
alone
someone
who
had
exchanged
bovine
nicknames
with
a
Masai
warrior
)
was
capable
of
any
such
omniscience
.
This
is
the
nature
of
sciences
and
pseudo-sciences
,
always
striving
for
a
set
of
rules
and
final
solutions
.
Claudia
probably
took
heart
from
another
of
Mauss
's
strictures
that
the
ethnographer
should
not
only
observe
the
particular
but
keep
in
mind
the
context
.
Her
thesis
has
its
gaze
on
the
exact
detail
of
the
exchange
of
cattle
,
goats
,
blankets
,
gourds
and
snuff
,
and
it
tries
to
establish
by
the
comparative
method
that
these
customs
are
part
of
universal
human
practice
.
The
details
of
the
comparative
method
are
a
little
sketchy
,
but
she
claims
that
Melanesian
practice
is
very
similar
.
The
poor
anonymous
Melanesians
,
famous
only
in
anthropology
.
As
I
look
out
of
my
window
-
the
scene
is
as
interesting
to
me
as
a
Canaletto
-
I
see
the
clouds
suddenly
begin
to
rise
o
at
high
speed
,
like
a
milkshake
being
drawn
up
a
straw
,
the
top
layers
,
the
fluffy
stuff
,
going
last
.
I
wonder
if
she
had
sex
with
Tepilit
.
I
reproach
myself
at
the
same
time
.
Who
is
to
say
what
it
was
like
living
out
on
the
plains
for
months
on
end
,
at
first
in
a
tent
and
then
in
a
small
house
,
not
much
more
than
a
hut
,
built
of
saplings
,
mud
,
and
cow
dung
,
which
she
equipped
with
Somali
fabrics
and
safari
furniture
?
I
suspect
what
Claudia
really
discovered
about
the
universal
spirit
was
more
personal
than
scientific
.
The
Masai
believe
that
when
a
woman
has
sex
with
a
younger
man
(
in
truth
I
have
no
way
of
knowing
the
relative
ages
)
the
woman
becomes
younger
and
more
beautiful
.
Perhaps
this
,
too
,
was
part
of
the
total
social
fact
.
As
I
speculate
about
Claudia
having
sex
with
a
Masai
warrior
,
I
wonder
if
Fairfax
was
troubled
by
these
thoughts
.
Letterman
's
notion
of
the
universal
spirit
has
a
commercial
aspect
:
it
stands
for
that
human
striving
which
exists
as
a
counter
to
the
banality
of
human
life
in
the
suburbs
and
malls
of
our
countries
.
According
to
this
flattering
theory
,
the
audience
are
players
in
a
bigger
drama
.
The
human
spirit
is
trundled
on
to
reassure
them
that
they
are
still
party
to
the
heroic
,
which
cynical
people
might
think
has
departed
the
suburbs
some
time
ago
.
The
walls
of
the
police
cell
where
Tepilit
was
held
are
still
visible
.
On
one
side
they
are
at
full
height
.
The
distinct
lozenges
of
mud
have
gone
,
worn
down
by
the
weather
,
but
it
is
possible
to
see
their
outlines
in
the
dissolving
walls
.
They
are
like
sugar
lumps
in
tea
,
moments
before
they
vanish
.
Near
the
old
police
station
is
a
compound
of
very
tall
barbed
wire
,
with
a
collar
pointing
outwards
to
prevent
intrusion
.
It
has
no
purpose
as
there
is
no
gate
.
In
this
compound
a
huge
piece
of
road-making
equipment
,
a
Hanomag
grader
,
rests
on
breeze
blocks
.
It
has
lost
its
tyres
and
most
of
its
engine
;
what
is
left
is
the
crude
metal
,
as
simple
as
a
wheelbarrow
.
It
looks
as
though
it
stopped
work
a
decade
ago
.
There
was
a
period
of
austerity
in
government
fiscal
policy
when
spares
could
not
be
imported
.
The
police
have
moved
to
another
town
further
up
the
river
which
gives
Ewaso
Narok
its
name
,
Black
River
.
Now
Ewaso
Narok
is
,
apart
from
the
stranded
earth-mover
,
home
only
to
two
bars
and
a
shop
selling
soap
,
maize
meal
and
other
staples
.
Masai
elders
enter
these
tiny
shacks
,
elegant
in
their
cloaks
and
blankets
but
looking
to
me
-
from
the
dusty
,
baking
cab
of
my
Toyota
-
shifty
.
You
see
these
people
,
the
ones
who
have
overdone
the
booze
,
in
ail
tribal
places
,
confirming
,
like
some
Victorian
temperance
tract
,
the
dangers
of
drink
.
Their
eyes
are
yellow
,
their
focus
unsteady
and
their
stride
is
either
exaggeratedly
purposeful
or
shambling
.
One
elder
in
a
blanket
rests
his
sticks
against
the
wall
of
the
former
jail
and
has
a
pee
,
contributing
minutely
to
the
eventual
disappearance
of
the
police
station
.
In
front
of
the
former
police
station
is
a
weeping
pepper
tree
and
some
huge
but
untidy
cacti
,
giant
fibrous
plants
.
It
is
possible
to
reconstruct
the
police
post
in
the
mind
's
eye
,
a
small
building
,
tin-roofed
,
with
a
verandah
and
a
line
of
large
white
painted
rocks
which
contained
a
garden
of
cacti
and
the
youthful
version
of
this
lachrymose
tree
.
I
am
thinking
of
a
scene
at
this
police
post
,
the
arrest
of
Tepilit
,
the
intervention
of
Fairfax
,
the
impressive
dignity
of
the
accused
and
the
relentless
,
incomprehensible
workings
of
the
white
man
's
justice
.
The
track
out
of
Ewaso
Narok
is
hard
to
follow
.
It
soon
unravels
like
thread
falling
off
a
spindle
.
I
take
what
I
hope
is
the
main
path
.
Really
,
I
do
n't
care
if
I
get
lost
.
I
have
no
fear
and
,
despite
the
deadline
Letterman
has
conjured
up
,
no
sense
of
urgency
.
I
stop
to
give
a
lift
to
two
young
warriors
who
are
fully
made
up
in
ochre
topped
by
head-dresses
.
Hours
of
work
have
gone
into
their
plaited
hair
.
They
have
a
curious
way
of
sitting
on
the
back
seat
,
unfamiliar
with
the
correct
posture
.
As
the
Toyota
moves
forward
they
fall
backwards
.
One
reaches
over
my
shoulder
and
cranes
his
neck
so
that
he
can
look
at
himself
in
the
mirror
.
In
Swahili
I
ask
them
where
they
are
going
.
They
are
heading
for
a
gathering
at
a
place
I
can
not
see
on
my
map
,
but
they
seem
content
with
the
direction
I
have
chosen
.
From
them
comes
a
smell
which
I
find
achingly
familiar
:
they
and
their
spears
and
shields
give
off
the
scent
of
Africa
:
woodsmoke
,
hides
,
cattle
and
dust
.
We
travel
almost
in
silence
for
a
few
miles
.
They
inspect
any
other
Masai
they
see
on
the
track
closely
.
Only
then
do
they
speak
.
One
of
the
boys
bangs
the
seat
right
behind
my
head
urgently
,
and
indicates
that
I
should
stop
to
pick
up
another
couple
of
young
warriors
.
These
two
boys
say
nothing
to
me
as
they
get
in
,
first
handing
their
weapons
to
their
friends
.
We
come
to
a
river
,
absent
from
my
map
,
where
suddenly
I
see
the
plains
and
both
banks
smeared
with
colour
.
A
few
hundred
Masai
are
gathered
,
the
later
arrivals
dotting
the
savannah
to
the
south
,
advancing
in
pairs
or
small
knots
of
red
and
purple
.
The
plain
is
like
a
field
of
poppies
,
with
the
flowers
growing
most
thickly
near
the
river
.
The
boys
get
out
of
the
Toyota
.
One
sticks
his
head
in
my
window
and
says
,
"
Thank
you
.
"
He
is
practising
his
English
,
without
any
reference
to
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
.
A
hunter
turned
safari
operator
,
Oskar
Koenig
,
describes
a
ceremony
he
calls
the
Festival
of
Love
which
he
purports
to
have
witnessed
:
"
One
of
the
young
men
knelt
by
the
cowhide
near
a
hole
in
the
ground
,
which
,
as
I
knew
,
was
meant
to
resemble
the
vagina
.
His
young
body
reared
in
sexuality
,
when
he
performed
the
act
of
fecundation
-
"
According
to
Koenig
,
this
led
to
a
month-long
orgy
involving
virgins
and
she-asses
garlanded
for
the
occasion
.
(
The
asses
probably
owe
something
to
Koenig
's
native
Bavaria
,
where
uxorious
cows
are
garlanded
and
brought
up
to
the
Alpine
pastures
each
summer
.
)
Koenig
,
concealed
behind
some
rocks
,
watched
this
ceremony
for
some
hours
.
He
was
deeply
impressed
by
the
monumental
nature
of
this
sexual
feast
,
Wagnerian
in
its
scale
.
He
concludes
:
"
So
although
at
first
it
is
also
natural
for
civilized
people
to
condemn
out
of
hand
what
I
had
just
witnessed
as
disgraceful
heathen
bestiality
,
they
,
too
,
if
they
were
honest
might
come
to
feel
it
was
at
least
partly
redeemed
by
the
genuine
religious
conviction
on
which
it
is
based
.
"
I
have
found
no
mention
of
this
Festival
of
Love
in
any
other
accounts
of
the
Masai
,
but
there
is
something
blatantly
sexual
about
the
warriors
.
They
are
like
heavy
metal
rock
stars
primped
and
primed
for
sex
.
Yet
-
like
my
friend
S.
O.
Letterman
-
they
have
a
gentle
,
effeminate
side
,
a
dandyism
and
a
preoccupation
with
details
of
appearance
and
decoration
.
The
plain
stretches
all
the
way
to
Lake
Natron
which
lies
sunk
below
the
hills
,
with
its
dead
still
ether
water
and
its
atolls
of
flamingos
.
From
this
apparently
empty
country
,
the
Masai
are
streaming
,
bright
rivulets
.
There
is
no
one
to
tell
me
what
is
going
on
.
I
imagine
this
is
how
Claudia
felt
.
I
walk
closer
to
the
river
where
there
are
some
huts
.
I
can
see
now
that
they
are
dancing
and
processing
around
the
boma
.
I
wonder
if
they
will
ask
me
to
go
,
but
apart
from
a
few
curious
glances
,
quickly
snuffed
,
they
ignore
me
.
I
am
floating
here
completely
alone
in
a
Masai
universe
.
The
warriors
now
form
a
line
and
skip
into
the
enclosure
.
A
second
group
approaches
from
the
other
side
and
lines
of
girls
form
in
the
middle
of
the
enclosure
to
admire
and
tease
them
.
One
of
the
warriors
is
in
a
fit
.
His
friends
carry
his
rigid
,
moaning
body
to
one
side
and
an
older
woman
splashes
him
with
water
.
The
warriors
,
their
spears
resting
on
their
shoulders
,
take
very
small
steps
and
chant
in
time
,
breathy
snorts
-
"
Hooh
,
hooh
,
hooh
"
-
as
they
circle
the
girls
and
pass
the
second
line
of
warriors
,
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
.
The
girls
are
singing
now
,
a
high
,
nasal
whine
that
sounds
more
Arab
than
African
.
They
seem
to
find
the
sexual
promenading
of
the
warriors
amusing
.
They
are
laden
with
beads
and
their
breasts
are
bobbing
and
rippling
with
static
.
After
an
hour
or
more
the
dancing
stops
.
Some
Masai
are
drifting
away
.
Again
the
plain
blooms
.
I
move
on
.
Nobody
takes
much
notice
.
The
sun
is
low
now
and
I
need
a
lot
of
time
to
pitch
my
tent
where
I
am
headed
,
the
dry
watercourse
near
the
laibon
's
village
.
I
drive
along
the
track
,
my
heart
full
.
I
have
left
behind
a
perfect
segment
of
the
universe
we
inhabit
so
blindly
.
Claudia
must
have
seen
something
like
this
many
times
-
dances
,
endless
dances
,
meaning
what
?
perhaps
meaning
nothing
until
you
come
along
and
ask
what
they
mean
.
I
have
an
overwhelming
feeling
that
these
dances
which
have
been
going
on
unchanged
for
hundreds
,
perhaps
thousands
of
years
,
are
truer
to
the
"
âme
collective
"
than
our
restless
,
critical
,
self-obsessed
quadrilles
.
Yet
even
as
I
think
it
,
I
know
it
to
be
a
ridiculous
thought
.
We
are
all
dancing
hopefully
and
blindly
,
in
our
own
way
.
The
canvas
of
my
tent
(
to
be
exact
,
not
canvas
but
a
green
plastic
material
)
is
flapping
in
the
breeze
which
comes
over
the
plains
and
stirs
the
dry
leaves
where
they
lie
on
the
bottom
of
the
dry
river
.
Outside
,
the
embers
of
my
fire
glow
as
the
breeze
fans
them
.
A
lion
roars
in
the
dense
thicket
into
which
the
watercourse
runs
.
Over
at
the
laibon
's
engang
they
are
bedded
down
behind
their
own
thicket
of
thorn
bushes
,
the
cattle
jammed
together
in
a
large
boma
and
the
goats
in
a
smaller
one
right
in
the
middle
,
as
far
from
the
athletic
leopards
as
possible
.
My
travel
alarm
glows
in
the
dark
.
It
is
four
thirty
in
the
morning
.
I
am
out
here
alone
,
unprotected
,
only
a
thin
piece
of
plastic-canvas
away
from
lions
,
buffalo
,
leopards
and
hyena
.
But
I
am
more
disturbed
by
the
sharp
,
diving
whine
of
a
mosquito
,
which
produces
an
anticipatory
tension
by
its
frequency
alone
,
just
like
the
moment
when
the
dentist
turned
on
his
drill
and
swung
the
whole
clumsy
contraption
over
my
youthful
,
gaping
mouth
.
I
wonder
if
the
children
in
the
engang
are
frightened
.
Our
own
children
are
now
so
far
removed
from
danger
,
at
least
of
the
primal
kind
,
and
these
Masai
are
so
close
to
it
,
that
you
would
expect
them
to
be
cowed
and
fearful
.
Outside
the
engang
is
a
night
world
into
which
the
Masai
never
venture
.
It
is
a
combat
zone
which
they
concede
to
the
predators
until
morning
,
when
they
drive
out
their
cattle
again
past
sleeping
lions
and
strangely
reticent
hyena
.
The
children
are
left
out
on
the
plains
with
a
few
goats
from
a
very
young
age
.
Yet
as
they
step
forward
for
a
greeting
,
receiving
the
palms
of
your
hands
on
their
springy
hair
,
they
show
no
sign
of
fear
or
anxiety
.
With
their
monsters
and
wolves
and
unpredictable
dangers
,
fairy
stories
are
supposed
to
prepare
children
for
life
in
some
symbolic
fashion
.
Here
the
dangers
are
real
.
In
the
few
weeks
that
have
gone
by
a
boy
from
the
village
has
been
killed
by
an
elephant
.
If
my
understanding
is
correct
,
the
boy
was
looking
for
a
missing
goat
on
the
edge
of
the
thicket
when
he
was
charged
by
a
cow
elephant
and
killed
.
There
is
no
mourning
for
children
;
by
the
next
day
the
body
was
eaten
by
the
hyenas
.
There
is
a
compensation
scheme
and
the
laibon
wishes
me
to
drive
one
of
his
sons
fifty
miles
to
a
small
town
to
collect
the
papers
.
My
arrival
and
my
anticipated
help
with
the
paperwork
have
been
fortuitous
.
I
do
n't
like
to
ask
how
much
money
they
will
receive
from
the
government
,
but
the
laibon
tells
me
:
seventy-five
dollars
,
the
price
of
two
new
cows
.
I
realize
that
the
forty-nine
cows
that
were
offered
to
the
district
officer
's
relatives
was
a
huge
sum
,
however
you
measure
it
.
And
the
district
officer
's
family
got
nothing
.
Dawn
is
approaching
.
The
roof
of
the
tent
begins
to
glow
,
like
the
mantle
of
a
gas
lamp
turned
up
very
slowly
.
It
is
cool
outside
as
I
throw
a
log
on
the
gently
breathing
embers
.
I
put
the
kettle
,
already
nicely
blackened
and
battered
,
into
the
pile
of
ash
and
climb
back
into
my
camp
bed
.
Wakefulness
at
this
time
of
day
is
notoriously
unsettling
:
in
London
it
brings
balls
of
anxiety
to
the
gut
as
the
sodden
city
outside
sneers
at
the
sleepless
.
Here
I
feel
awake
and
ready
,
compelled
to
be
on
my
feet
when
the
sun
reaches
us
,
and
the
cattle
,
fretful
and
peckish
,
are
released
in
a
torrent
of
bay
and
brown
and
white
,
their
huge
horns
gradually
unlocking
and
separating
as
they
spread
out
into
the
plain
.
The
warriors
always
accompany
them
when
they
must
travel
long
distances
to
find
green
grass
.
Green
grass
,
green
grass
.
Pre-dawn
.
Claudia
lying
in
her
hut
listening
for
the
first
sounds
of
life
.
A
satisfying
pile
of
notes
and
tapes
accumulating
.
The
tapes
,
the
same
ones
I
have
back
at
Mr
Shah
's
cumin-scented
hotel
,
neatly
stacked
on
a
shelf
made
from
a
tea-chest
draped
with
Somali
cloth
.
Over
at
the
engang
they
are
starting
their
fires
into
life
.
Is
Claudia
longing
for
her
Masai
lover
?
When
and
where
does
he
visit
her
?
The
emptiness
of
the
landscape
is
illusory
;
there
is
no
privacy
here
.
A
warrior
will
plant
his
spear
outside
one
of
the
small
huts
to
indicate
that
he
is
inside
and
should
not
be
disturbed
,
but
I
ca
n't
imagine
Claudia
,
chic
Parisienne
,
et
cetera
,
allowing
her
relationship
to
be
semaphored
in
this
way
from
outside
her
own
hut
.
As
I
lie
here
under
the
green
,
seaweedy
tent
I
remember
from
some
trite
television
interview
,
a
remark
made
by
Brigitte
Bardot
,
loopy
Parisienne
,
namely
that
in
all
her
many
love
affairs
she
was
off
at
the
first
sign
of
the
waning
of
passion
.
Perhaps
Claudia
grew
tired
of
Tepilit
.
Perhaps
the
cultural
divide
was
emphasized
by
being
lovers
and
she
quickly
found
she
had
nothing
to
say
to
him
.
Victoria
and
I
have
undoubtedly
passed
that
milepost
.
Victoria
thinks
that
I
am
not
sufficiently
in
love
with
her
to
want
children
.
Even
the
most
liberated
women
believe
that
there
is
an
evident
connection
between
sex
and
children
,
a
notion
whose
truth
is
only
tested
after
the
event
.
After
her
unfaithfulness
,
I
found
the
connection
severed
.
If
the
purpose
of
sex
is
to
have
children
,
then
,
is
there
a
special
sort
of
casual
,
slightly
illicit
sex
with
near-strangers
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
procreation
and
is
also
more
exciting
than
the
other
steady
sort
?

I
'm
the
injured
party
,
yet
she
is
suffering
more
than
I
am
.
The
sun
is
now
striking
the
tent
and
the
trees
around
,
producing
an
underwater
effect
on
my
green
tent
like
kelp
swaying
in
a
tide
.
I
clamber
out
of
bed
.
I
have
to
make
a
great
effort
to
keep
the
tent
tidy
.
It
's
amazing
how
quickly
my
few
possessions
become
disarranged
.
Claudia
lived
here
for
nearly
four
years
,
creating
a
small
,
domestic
homestead
.
Often
she
would
go
to
Nairobi
or
the
coast
for
a
break
and
to
get
supplies
.
The
fire
burns
evenly
with
a
thin
hot
flame
,
as
though
there
are
no
oils
or
resins
in
the
wood
.
I
am
drinking
my
coffee
from
a
tin
mug
,
bacon
frying
in
the
pan
and
scenting
the
air
,
and
toasting
a
large
slice
of
bread
on
a
fork
,
as
the
bee-eaters
begin
their
busy
day
and
the
vervet
monkeys
start
to
squabble
.
Although
I
know
that
in
these
matters
there
is
almost
no
limit
to
what
people
will
do
,
I
am
horrified
that
Victoria
should
have
subjected
herself
to
an
Aids
test
and
-
as
I
have
heard
happens
-
the
offers
of
emotional
counselling
and
financial
advice
.
My
heart
,
however
,
does
not
respond
in
the
desired
way
to
her
letter
and
certificate
.
I
see
it
as
a
silly
gesture
springing
from
her
work
in
advertising
,
the
promotion
of
appearance
over
substance
.
What
she
wo
n't
want
to
hear
is
that
I
am
cured
of
the
madness
which
kept
me
from
sleeping
at
night
and
the
imagination
which
played
havoc
with
my
peace
of
mind
during
the
day
.
This
seems
to
be
the
way
it
is
with
men
and
women
;
buckets
of
water
from
a
well
,
one
drawing
deep
while
the
other
is
empty
,
and
so
on
,
as
if
there
is
a
physical
law
governing
the
amount
of
emotional
nourishment
available
to
a
couple
.
Bardot
with
her
crazy
affection
for
animals
,
Claudia
and
her
unspeakable
death
,
Victoria
and
her
Aids
test
:
I
see
them
all
linked
in
some
fashion
.
I
see
women
as
closer
to
the
tragic
than
men
because
of
the
frailty
of
their
expectations
which
have
no
solid
foundation
in
the
world
.
I
see
their
hopes
like
Masai
villages
,
impermanent
and
leaving
few
marks
on
the
landscape
.
Of
course
,
I
could
never
tell
any
woman
these
thoughts
.
Perhaps
,
like
Letterman
,
I
think
of
myself
as
having
some
useful
feminine
understanding
.
The
bacon
is
strongly
scented
,
very
porcine
;
in
the
pan
it
is
not
going
brown
but
looking
more
like
a
slice
of
pig
than
bacon
should
.
I
prod
it
with
a
fork
and
brown
it
on
the
fire
before
introducing
it
to
the
thick
slice
of
toast
.
Another
cup
of
coffee
is
ready
as
I
bite
into
my
breakfast
.
It
's
surprisingly
good
even
though
the
presentiments
of
pig
are
confirmed
by
the
taste
.
I
throw
the
rind
,
as
thick
as
a
pencil
,
in
the
direction
of
the
vervet
monkeys
,
but
they
show
no
understanding
of
my
offer
.
Nobody
has
ever
donated
anything
to
them
before
.
From
across
the
open
stretch
of
ground
hemmed
in
by
the
watercourse
and
the
thicket
,
from
at
least
half
a
mile
away
,
I
can
clearly
hear
the
engang
preparing
for
the
damburst
of
cattle
.
I
hurry
over
in
that
direction
.
I
am
impelled
there
.
The
grass
is
so
dry
it
seems
impossible
that
it
can
ever
come
to
life
again
:
yet
the
huge
acacia
trees
along
the
riverbed
are
putting
out
blossom
,
delicate
sprigs
of
green
in
anticipation
of
the
rains
to
come
.
Mana
.
The
old
anthropological
concept
dreamed
up
in
the
universities
to
describe
the
potentialities
of
nature
as
understood
by
primitive
people
.
As
I
stride
across
the
plain
I
feel
I
have
a
glimmering
of
what
it
means
.
It
means
a
nervous
dependence
upon
nature
,
a
relationship
with
a
step-parent
who
can
never
be
entirely
relied
upon
.
Non-stop
vigilance
and
propitiation
are
advisable
.
The
importance
of
trying
to
keep
in
nature
's
good
books
is
plain
as
the
cattle
call
and
stamp
impatiently
.
Today
the
laibon
is
expecting
me
to
take
his
son
in
the
Toyota
.
His
son
is
standing
near
the
main
entrance
,
ready
for
the
journey
,
carrying
a
stick
,
a
spear
and
a
small
leather
bottle
,
similar
to
the
sort
of
thing
drunken
youths
use
to
squirt
wine
down
their
throats
before
braving
the
bulls
in
Pamplona
.
(
I
have
done
this
myself
although
no
bull
came
anywhere
near
me
.
)
The
cattle
are
thin
and
some
are
listless
but
so
far
there
have
been
no
deaths
.
The
young
men
split
the
cattle
into
two
groups
and
head
off
to
find
pasture
.
Two
girls
are
loading
the
donkeys
with
water
containers
and
sacks
.
They
greet
me
,
but
they
are
amused
by
my
appearance
.
I
see
them
discussing
me
;
one
of
them
doubles
up
.
They
compose
themselves
as
the
laibon
appears
and
suggests
we
sit
down
for
tea
.
With
a
few
whacks
and
some
loud
whistles
,
they
drive
the
donkeys
out
of
the
enclosure
.
The
laibon
's
face
is
always
troubled
,
as
though
the
thoughts
which
are
his
special
preserve
are
weighing
on
him
heavily
.
He
drinks
the
tea
brought
to
us
by
the
koko
gravely
,
and
makes
exasperated
noises
.
The
laibon
's
son
,
paramat
,
and
I
walk
back
to
my
camp
.
He
is
tall
with
an
elongated
,
finely
made
face
,
a
Masai
face
,
lending
some
weight
to
the
myth
that
the
Masai
came
from
the
Nile
.
When
he
smiles
,
he
looks
slightly
goofy
,
the
skin
pulled
right
over
his
cheeks
like
the
face
children
make
by
sticking
their
fingers
in
the
corners
of
their
mouths
.
Mr
Shah
's
fax
machine
has
been
working
overtime
.
Faxes
have
arrived
at
all
hours
from
LA
and
London
.
As
I
pull
up
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
Mr
Shah
is
waiting
with
a
folder
full
;
his
expression
,
although
friendly
,
contains
around
his
mouth
a
little
reproach
that
I
should
have
been
away
from
the
action
for
so
long
.
"
I
've
been
up
to
my
ears
,
"
he
says
.
There
have
been
many
diversions
.
It
took
us
some
time
to
get
to
Kitumbeine
and
the
district
officer
had
knocked
off
.
We
found
him
drunk
in
his
bungalow
.
With
the
promise
of
money
he
accompanied
us
to
his
office
for
the
forms
.
He
had
trouble
finding
them
and
managed
to
catch
his
finger
in
a
filing
cabinet
.
There
seemed
to
me
no
chance
of
the
necessary
chain
of
events
being
completed
.
The
office
,
which
displayed
portraits
of
both
the
last
president
and
the
new
one
,
was
filled
with
stale
air
.
It
was
air
into
which
farts
and
old
food
odours
had
been
released
,
but
which
was
completely
inert
,
as
though
in
some
way
lacking
ions
or
ozone
,
because
the
air
conditioner
had
not
worked
for
years
and
the
windows
were
sealed
.
If
the
telephones
had
rung
you
would
have
taken
fright
.
They
were
Bakelite
and
dusty
.
Bundles
of
papers
and
box
files
were
stacked
on
termite-proof
metal
shelves
but
their
labels
had
faded
.
Paramat
stood
by
the
doorway
with
the
attitude
of
a
tourist
at
the
shrine
of
an
exotic
religious
sect
.
He
was
both
eager
to
adopt
the
right
stance
and
unnerved
by
the
strangeness
of
it
.
The
lodging
of
a
compensation
form
,
a
simple
enough
matter
,
here
required
a
respect
for
ritual
.
There
had
to
be
more
to
it
than
simply
filling
in
a
few
spaces
with
a
ballpoint
;
greater
symbolic
weight
was
required
.
The
money
dispensers
in
the
capital
could
only
be
approached
through
their
acolyte
,
whose
job
it
was
to
demand
some
offerings
and
make
the
right
moves
to
ensure
success
.
The
district
officer
wanted
to
know
if
suitable
precautions
had
been
taken
to
avoid
the
elephants
.
I
enquired
about
the
nature
of
these
precautions
.
"
They
are
ferocious
beasts
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
these
people
sometimes
are
ignoring
the
law
of
the
jungle
.
Some
of
them
are
even
looking
out
for
compensation
.
"
Eventually
the
police
certificate
was
accepted
,
the
forms
were
filled
and
stamped
,
and
placed
in
a
tray
marked
"
out
"
.
I
felt
they
might
have
a
better
chance
of
getting
to
the
capital
if
they
were
folded
into
paper
aeroplanes
and
launched
out
of
the
door
.
So
I
have
been
away
longer
than
I
said
I
would
be
,
and
Mr
Shah
is
a
little
surprised
at
my
dereliction
.
To
him
the
outside
world
,
in
particular
Los
Angeles
and
London
,
is
humming
with
importance
.
I
would
hate
to
have
to
explain
to
him
the
true
state
of
affairs
.
He
hands
me
a
brown
manila
file
,
and
a
handwritten
invoice
which
I
imagine
he
is
giving
to
me
now
while
the
connection
between
the
reams
of
faxes
and
the
many
noughts
,
in
local
shillings
,
of
his
invoice
is
still
fresh
.
He
asks
me
about
my
safari
,
but
I
know
that
what
happens
out
there
is
of
no
interest
to
him
.
Out
there
-
not
so
far
,
as
from
it
happens
the
centre
of
the
town
-
a
realm
of
nothingness
exists
.
From
out
there
,
however
,
the
view
is
very
different
.
There
are
some
new
faces
in
the
dining
room
,
a
Danish
family
of
mother
,
father
and
four
small
children
.
The
sun
has
crabbed
their
gaze
so
that
when
they
turn
to
me
I
see
a
row
of
puppies
squinting
.
When
I
returned
to
the
laibon
's
village
with
the
paperwork
,
he
was
looking
out
towards
Ol
Doinyo
Lengai
waiting
for
the
sound
and
the
dust
and
the
cries
of
his
cattle
coming
back
.
We
handed
over
the
stamped
forms
,
which
he
gave
to
the
koko
for
safe
keeping
.
The
newly
born
goats
were
kept
in
a
pen
under
her
bed
.
I
wondered
where
she
would
keep
these
papers
.
"
Fahfakhs
is
coming
,
"
the
laibon
said
in
Swahili
.
I
did
n't
know
if
this
was
a
question
or
a
prediction
.
I
had
told
him
that
I
had
met
Fairfax
.
He
was
n't
surprised
that
Fairfax
was
still
alive
.
Now
I
have
his
message
:
"
Glad
to
help
if
I
can
.
Stop
.
Memory
not
what
it
was
.
Stop
.
Please
contact
me
at
Muthaiga
.
Stop
.
Thomas
Fairfax
.
"
So
perhaps
the
laibon
's
pebbles
,
worn
smooth
by
his
hands
and
his
predecessors
,
right
back
to
the
great
Mbatian
,
had
told
him
.
The
laibon
asked
me
to
sit
in
the
boma
,
and
pointed
to
my
tape-recorder
.
He
had
much
on
his
mind
.
I
lie
down
on
my
bed
and
remove
my
socks
before
looking
at
the
folder
.
Letterman
would
like
to
see
a
first
draft
by
the
time
I
meet
him
in
London
.
My
legs
are
shaded
by
the
dust
which
has
gathered
over
the
past
few
days
,
so
that
the
contrast
is
like
a
Coppertone
ad
,
with
the
puppy
pulling
a
little
girl
's
knickers
off
.
I
look
at
my
legs
critically
.
God
knows
how
much
time
we
spend
in
our
lives
scrutinizing
our
bodies
.
My
legs
are
now
pleasantly
brown
,
quite
well
formed
,
I
believe
.
I
am
happy
to
see
them
in
this
workmanlike
state
.
It
confirms
to
me
that
I
am
far
from
the
northern
climates
,
the
habitat
of
the
Brussels
sprout
,
where
something
sickly
was
spreading
over
my
relationship
with
Victoria
-
just
like
the
smell
of
overcooked
vegetables
.
When
I
think
of
Victoria
,
now
not
very
often
,
I
no
longer
think
of
her
lips
in
fellatio
with
a
stranger
in
a
hotel
room
;
instead
I
remember
their
former
,
framboise
state
.
I
do
n't
feel
that
churning
,
dread
longing
any
more
which
seemed
like
a
curse
from
an
irrational
and
limitless
supply
of
malevolence
.
I
could
n't
bear
to
be
in
its
thrall
for
another
day
.
I
had
to
go
.
I
do
n't
suppose
she
will
understand
this
,
or
the
connection
I
am
making
,
tentatively
,
with
Claudia
's
fate
.
Here
in
Mr
Shah
's
hotel
or
out
on
the
plains
I
find
myself
making
all
sorts
of
airy
leaps
and
connections
effortlessly
.
I
seem
to
be
free
of
mundane
anxieties
.
I
can
see
now
the
attraction
of
those
religions
which
exalt
the
achievement
of
personal
tranquillity
above
ail
else
.
Really
they
are
invitations
to
live
the
life
of
the
mind
,
however
ill-equipped
the
mind
may
be
.
Professor
Uitsmijter
has
suggested
what
at
first
seems
a
crazy
solution
to
my
translation
problems
:
I
place
my
tape-recorder
next
to
the
phone
,
he
records
the
laibon
's
words
in
Nairobi
and
he
faxes
back
the
translation
.
He
has
some
electronic
equipment
originally
intended
for
the
language
laboratory
,
which
enhances
the
sound
quality
.
As
a
result
,
my
telephone
and
fax
bill
is
much
greater
than
the
bill
for
board
and
lodging
.
Mr
Shah
is
becoming
concerned
:
he
sees
something
unbusinesslike
in
me
which
I
accept
must
be
visible
to
others
.
Victoria
says
I
have
"
blind
spots
,
quite
amazing
blind
spots
about
the
real
world
for
someone
who
likes
to
think
he
is
so
aware
"
.
I
have
made
more
progress
with
the
script
.
I
have
written
the
ending
,
incorporating
Letterman
's
new
lines
.
I
have
also
started
to
write
about
the
lion
hunt
organized
by
Claudia
for
Waindell
Leavitt
.
But
already
I
am
running
into
problems
.
How
do
you
make
a
film
of
a
man
faking
a
documentary
about
a
lion
hunt
?
How
will
Letterman
fake
that
?
And
on
that
subject
,
how
much
of
the
unknown
and
unknowable
can
I
sketch
in
?
Elie
Wiesel
said
a
novel
about
Auschwitz
is
either
not
a
novel
or
not
about
Auschwitz
.
What
about
a
movie
where
the
main
character
ends
up
in
Auschwitz
?
This
is
not
supposed
to
be
fiction
,
but
as
I
write
I
find
myself
obliged
to
make
a
judgement
about
Leavitt
.
Leavitt
's
bombastic
,
trivial
films
were
completely
phoney
.
Claudia
must
have
known
that
.
Modern
audiences
-
I
can
hear
Letterman
saying
this
-
wo
n't
go
for
the
idea
that
Claudia
,
who
is
in
some
senses
-
although
we
"
re
not
spelling
this
out
,
okay
-
a
new
woman
,
would
take
part
in
the
killing
of
lions
for
a
documentary
.
Instead
we
must
present
this
sequence
as
entirely
Waindell
Leavitt
's
folly
,
into
which
Claudia
is
drawn
in
some
way
to
protect
the
Masai
against
manipulation
.
Leavitt
becomes
that
stock
character
,
the
insensitive
male
exploiter
.
But
Claudia
's
notes
tell
another
story
:
she
was
intrigued
by
the
whole
idea
and
even
suggested
to
Leavitt
where
they
might
find
lions
.
It
did
n't
take
her
long
to
regret
taking
part
.
Also
,
I
am
wondering
what
part
Claudia
's
lover
,
the
laibon
's
brother
,
should
take
in
this
.
After
he
is
wounded
in
this
staged
hunt
,
perhaps
she
could
be
seen
to
nurse
him
daily
with
iodine
and
mercurochrome
,
out
of
remorse
,
but
in
the
process
establishing
the
first
physical
contact
.
I
have
suggested
that
we
use
Maa
with
subtitles
(
I
am
thinking
of
Dances
With
Wolves
and
The
Last
of
the
Mohicans
)
.
This
scene
could
convey
the
burgeoning
friendship
and
even
love
effectively
.
The
initial
,
halting
conversation
would
be
about
Masai
bravery
and
the
importance
of
showing
no
pain
.
Tepilit
would
question
her
about
her
interest
in
Masai
women
and
why
she
seemed
so
concerned
with
their
unremarkable
tasks
.
She
would
explain
the
nature
of
her
interest
,
so
awakening
in
him
a
wish
to
know
more
about
what
goes
on
outside
Masailand
and
also
opening
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
white
folk
see
the
Masai
as
childlike
.
Of
course
,
Claudia
is
sensitive
to
the
nuances
.
She
tries
to
warn
him
.
She
says
that
the
outside
world
has
plenty
of
its
own
problems
.
The
audience
,
but
not
Tepilit
,
understands
by
now
her
father
's
situation
in
Paris
,
so
her
warnings
are
poignant
.
But
he
is
keen
to
join
the
King
's
African
Rifles
and
go
off
and
fight
.
She
discourages
him
.
After
a
few
days
he
is
well
enough
to
travel
and
one
of
Leavitt
's
Willys
safari
cars
takes
them
home
.
I
plan
a
scene
here
in
which
the
car
makes
its
way
through
the
vast
landscape
,
the
wounded
Masai
lying
in
the
back
.
As
they
approach
the
valley
overlooked
by
the
Mountain
of
God
,
he
asks
her
to
accept
from
him
the
gift
of
a
necklace
.
Before
she
can
answer
,
they
are
engulfed
by
a
crowd
of
young
warriors
,
who
want
to
hear
the
rumours
of
the
lion
hunt
and
the
fight
that
it
provoked
confirmed
.
In
this
way
,
she
has
become
part
of
the
total
social
fact
,
but
we
will
present
it
as
part
of
the
age-old
conflict
between
love
and
duty
.
Then
I
must
consider
the
nature
of
their
-
of
course
-
doomed
love
affair
.
Again
I
wonder
how
much
Fairfax
knows
.
Is
it
possible
that
in
1943
or
1944
she
would
have
told
him
,
liberated
Parisienne
that
she
was
,
the
details
?
Would
he
have
cross-questioned
her
?
(
I
am
probably
too
influenced
by
my
own
feelings
regarding
Victoria
.
)
I
can
see
that
for
the
purpose
of
our
movie
any
relationship
between
Claudia
and
Tepilit
will
have
to
be
clouded
in
romanticism
.
I
consider
the
question
of
kissing
.
Is
it
likely
that
they
would
have
kissed
?
Of
course
Red
Indian
(
Native
American
)
women
have
often
been
kissed
in
movies
by
cowboys
and
soldiers
,
but
how
do
we
think
a
six-foot-three-inch
Masai
,
almost
naked
,
kissing
a
French
woman
will
play
?
I
compose
a
fax
to
Letterman
.
I
need
guidance
on
how
sensational
he
wants
the
script
to
be
.
I
also
want
to
establish
the
degree
to
which
he
wants
to
be
true
to
the
facts
,
such
as
they
are
.
I
feel
sure
that
Claudia
would
have
shown
Tepilit
,
if
it
were
necessary
,
some
of
the
metropolitan
refinements
of
sexual
practice
.
And
yet
,
how
can
I
know
?
Perhaps
the
Masai
have
taboos
against
fellatio
and
the
other
things
the
French
,
with
their
gastronomic
traditions
,
favour
in
the
sexual
realm
.
I
also
wonder
if
she
feared
syphilis
.
Bror
Blixen
,
Karen
Blixen
's
husband
,
had
syphilis
and
it
was
said
to
be
common
among
the
Masai
.
But
then
the
settlers
-
settlers
in
all
countries
,
as
it
happens
-
were
particularly
receptive
to
uninformed
rumour
.
The
unruly
,
incomprehensible
natives
were
very
quickly
mythologized
.
Until
1942
there
was
no
reliable
cure
for
syphilis
,
too
late
for
Karen
Blixen
.
This
is
what
happens
:
you
start
by
wondering
whether
two
people
kiss
and
it
leads
away
into
the
unknowable
.
I
see
now
that
the
simplest
reconstruction
is
fraught
with
difficulty
.
And
yet
there
are
two
witnesses
-
three
if
you
count
Lady
De
Marr
-
still
alive
.
Of
course
,
there
are
no
witnesses
to
what
happened
at
the
other
end
of
her
journey
.
Pondering
these
problems
,
I
stand
by
the
window
.
The
river
has
been
flowing
quite
violently
recently
as
the
clouds
(
which
the
laibon
was
scanning
each
day
)
,
collide
with
the
summit
of
the
mountain
,
up
above
the
religious
suburbs
to
produce
rain
.
There
has
been
a
scandal
up
there
too
.
One
of
the
missionaries
has
been
badly
beaten
and
stabbed
.
It
is
said
that
he
was
interfering
with
the
choir
girls
,
some
of
whom
were
betrothed
.
My
informant
is
the
Anglican
vicar
.
Out
here
,
being
white
still
counts
for
a
lot
.
It
is
a
serious
matter
,
attacking
a
white
person
,
let
alone
a
white
minister
.
I
wonder
,
however
,
if
they
are
beginning
to
have
suspicions
about
our
parking-lot
creeds
and
oven-ready
ideas
.
This
local
Swaggart
,
who
has
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
preaches
the
gospel
,
is
tormented
by
the
rows
of
large
,
bobbing
girls
in
front
of
him
as
they
sing
the
bouncy
gospel
renditions
of
traditional
hymns
.
As
they
sway
and
raise
their
arms
,
he
sees
thirty
pairs
of
large
breasts
and
he
imagines
the
same
quantity
of
round
thighs
rolling
and
separating
under
the
cassocks
which
he
has
had
sent
from
Raleigh
.
In
the
vestry
and
in
his
bungalow
,
under
the
pretext
of
extra
rehearsal
,
he
has
been
fondling
these
big
brown
girls
and
offering
them
cigarettes
and
money
for
sex
.
Perhaps
he
has
succeeded
.
The
vicar
says
that
a
young
Larusa
,
Masai
after
all
,
has
stabbed
him
and
beaten
him
with
a
stick
and
the
whole
town
is
talking
about
it
.
Some
are
waiting
for
God
to
express
an
opinion
.
The
stakes
in
the
religious
free
market
have
been
raised
.
My
friend
the
vicar
is
uncharitably
pleased
.
There
is
something
gossipy
and
gay
about
him
.
His
conclusion
is
that
a
religion
which
counts
its
success
by
numbers
of
converts
is
suspect
.
He
seems
to
be
implying
that
sound
religions
are
those
which
are
hereditary
.
I
can
see
some
truth
in
this
.
Anyone
who
converts
must
have
a
motive
.
Many
of
Leon
Cohn-Casson
's
contemporaries
converted
in
order
to
be
more
French
.
They
believed
,
all
rational
men
believed
,
that
Judaism
was
simply
a
tribal
leftover
.
To
be
French
required
a
Western
European
faith
.
It
demanded
a
leafy
,
abundant
,
ovoid
religion
,
not
a
stony
,
nomadic
,
ascetic
religion
.
The
Jews
from
Alsace
,
the
intellectuals
,
were
convinced
that
a
separate
Jewish
identity
was
on
the
wane
anyway
.
Rational
thought
was
the
product
of
rational
ways
of
organizing
industry
.
Yet
here
on
the
mountain
in
the
last
decade
of
the
century
,
there
is
a
supermarket
of
discount
religions
.
Claudia
detects
a
relationship
between
religious
thought
and
the
way
Masai
society
is
organized
.
In
her
thesis
she
writes
about
it
,
but
she
also
-
I
surmise
-
sees
the
downside
(
as
Letterman
says
)
,
namely
that
none
of
these
religious
beliefs
will
be
sufficiently
adhesive
to
hold
Masai
society
together
once
the
other
solvents
get
to
work
.
And
what
Claudia
was
to
find
is
that
our
century
has
proved
that
the
irrational
and
the
immaterial
have
as
strong
a
hold
as
ever
.
This
way
for
the
showers
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
your
luggage
will
be
delivered
later
to
your
quarters
.
I
get
an
idea
for
another
scene
:
Claudia
makes
a
desperate
journey
to
see
the
Governor
to
try
to
have
Tepilit
reprieved
.
He
is
charming
and
urbane
,
naturally
,
but
refuses
to
help
.
He
has
no
grounds
for
interfering
in
due
process
.
He
suggests
that
the
rule
of
law
is
,
in
these
troubled
times
,
more
important
than
ever
,
but
the
audience
gets
the
impression
that
he
is
a
pompous
prick
,
giving
a
foreigner
a
little
lecture
about
how
things
are
done
in
the
Empire
.
In
desperation
she
tells
Fairfax
that
she
and
Tepilit
have
been
lovers
.
He
is
outraged
.
He
asks
her
to
go
to
a
doctor
to
be
tested
for
syphilis
.
A
new
cure
has
been
available
in
Europe
for
two
or
three
years
,
he
says
coldly
.
Tepilit
is
hanged
.
This
is
the
cause
of
their
separation
which
is
to
end
so
tragically
.
The
koko
served
us
tea
as
we
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
boma
after
the
cattle
had
gone
.
(
We
were
probably
sitting
on
about
three
feet
of
dried
dung
,
crumbly
and
friable
.
)
She
poured
the
tea
into
large
enamel
mugs
.
I
had
seen
the
donkeys
plodding
reluctantly
up
the
escarpment
to
fetch
water
miles
away
.
Donkeys
are
not
natural
enthusiasts
;
they
walk
as
if
they
have
arthritis
.
I
felt
guilty
that
this
hard-won
water
should
be
wasted
on
a
tea
ritual
when
I
had
gallons
of
mineral
water
at
my
camp
.
But
she
ministered
to
us
as
the
tape-recorder
whirred
.
The
tea
was
loaded
with
sugar
,
and
milk
from
a
gourd
was
added
in
a
thin
stream
like
milk
being
drawn
from
a
cow
's
udder
.
As
she
was
pouring
the
tea
it
occurred
to
me
that
maybe
she
knew
Claudia
too
.
She
was
the
first
of
the
laibon
's
four
wives
many
years
ago
.
Now
she
is
a
benign
presence
which
gives
the
engang
a
heart
.
I
am
now
reading
Uitsmijter
's
transcript
of
what
the
laibon
had
on
his
mind
.
The
owl
of
Minerva
flies
as
dusk
is
falling
:
the
laibon
believes
he
is
not
long
for
this
earth
.
He
has
had
some
revelations
which
he
wants
to
pass
on
to
me
.
They
are
that
the
rains
are
going
to
cease
falling
and
,
because
of
the
restrictions
placed
on
their
movement
,
the
Masai
will
not
be
able
to
follow
their
tradition
of
moving
on
.
As
I
read
,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
not
his
literal
meaning
.
He
is
voicing
the
complaint
of
all
old
people
about
the
closing
down
of
their
universe
.
Death
is
the
removal
of
all
the
possibilities
which
sustain
us
in
our
lives
.
But
also
,
I
guess
,
he
is
exercising
his
right
as
a
laibon
to
prophesy
.
Headmasters
,
senators
,
judges
,
priests
all
see
themselves
as
having
a
particular
duty
in
this
regard
.
A
politician
invited
to
make
the
wedding
speech
can
be
relied
upon
to
dish
up
some
predictions
along
with
the
eternal
verities
.
The
laibon
retells
the
accounts
of
his
illustrious
ancestors
of
the
great
migration
from
the
North
.
He
wants
me
,
for
some
reason
,
to
realize
that
he
knows
the
lights
are
going
out
in
the
Masai
world
.
He
sees
that
finally
the
Masai
myths
have
been
overtaken
.
He
tells
me
of
a
great
battle
his
ancestors
fought
near
Lake
Victoria
.
He
speaks
of
a
battle
against
the
Germans
.
He
prophesies
a
war
of
the
Masai
against
the
townies
.
(
I
wonder
if
he
realized
that
there
are
serried
ranks
of
townies
behind
the
front
line
that
he
has
encountered
.
)
The
pebbles
he
has
thrown
have
shown
these
things
.
The
uprising
against
the
townies
will
take
place
after
the
next
eunoto
,
which
is
the
gathering
of
thousands
of
warriors
at
the
end
of
their
time
as
morans
.
Thousands
of
warriors
collect
from
the
huge
Masai
district
to
have
their
heads
shaved
by
their
mothers
before
undergoing
rituals
to
launch
them
on
their
new
-
somewhat
dull
-
life
as
elders
.
There
is
no
music
,
only
the
hoarse
,
erratic
bellow
of
a
kudu
horn
and
the
chanting
,
a
strange
noise
which
comes
from
inside
the
earth
itself
,
as
though
the
rocks
and
the
soil
were
singing
as
best
they
could
.
The
infinite
possibilities
of
Masai
life
,
on
the
face
of
it
a
simple
desire
to
wander
the
earth
following
the
cattle
,
have
been
denied
.
Every
single
thing
the
Masai
value
depends
upon
this
possibility
.
This
is
the
object
of
life
.
It
is
life
.
Uitsmijter
,
under
the
academic
compulsion
to
explain
,
adds
a
note
about
the
nature
of
prophecy
among
the
Masai
and
-
the
comparative
method
-
among
other
tribes
such
as
the
Dinka
and
the
Nuer
.
Prophecy
is
expected
of
the
laibons
.
It
is
usually
expressed
in
the
vaguest
terms
,
like
a
horoscope
in
the
newspapers
.
Another
disciple
of
Nostradamus
,
S.
O.
Letterman
,
has
been
throwing
the
pebbles
in
LA
and
finds
the
omens
good
.
So
far
no
progress
with
the
female
lead
.
But
Mel
Gibson
likes
the
treatment
,
which
Letterman
himself
has
had
to
work
up
a
little
.
In
principle
he
would
like
to
do
the
movie
,
but
you
know
how
it
is
with
agents
.
(
I
do
n't
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
but
this
is
the
chummy
method
at
work
.
)
In
many
ways
the
time
is
right
-
fiftieth
anniversary
,
uncertainties
in
the
world
,
French
self-examination
and
so
on
-
for
just
such
a
movie
.
It
feels
right
.
The
response
is
good
.
He
is
off
to
Paris
to
interview
actresses
.
This
sounds
like
a
wonderful
opportunity
for
Letterman
to
bring
to
bear
his
feminine
understanding
on
eager
actresses
,
although
something
tells
me
that
his
Californian
slightly-absurd-boyish-middle-aged
charm
will
not
go
down
well
in
Paris
.
I
wonder
if
what
Mencken
called
"
the
usual
hypocrisies
"
are
n't
too
well
understood
by
women
in
Paris
.
I
am
sure
that
Letterman
would
like
to
have
some
of
Polanski
's
assurance
with
young
women
,
a
knowingness
which
makes
the
Californian
mania
for
self-presentation
look
quaint
.
The
success
-
I
am
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
thickly
carpeted
mountainside
-
comes
from
the
knowledge
of
shared
weakness
,
the
weakness
of
both
men
and
women
in
matters
of
sex
and
passion
.
It
does
not
arise
,
as
Letterman
imagines
,
from
impressing
on
women
your
sympathy
and
sensitivity
to
their
imagined
plight
.
This
is
why
bastards
continue
to
score
heavily
with
women
who
should
know
better
.
For
all
his
working
of
the
flesh
and
his
golden
suntan
and
his
deployment
of
pop
philosophies
and
credos
,
Letterman
is
too
contrived
an
individual
to
be
successful
with
the
sort
of
Frenchwoman
-
my
gaze
descends
from
the
mountain
to
my
backyard
where
they
are
pegging
out
a
goatskin
-
whom
he
desires
to
play
the
part
of
Claudia
.
But
I
ca
n't
be
sure
.
The
interviews
are
conducted
at
the
St
James
's
club
off
the
Avenue
Foch
.
Letterman
has
filled
his
suite
with
striking
vases
of
flowers
.
He
has
a
few
modish
novels
,
a
collection
of
articles
by
Paul
Bordieu
,
a
copy
of
the
New
York
Review
and
some
scripts
lying
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
sofa
where
he
sits
with
a
bottle
of
Yorre
-
never
Perrier
-
and
an
ice
bucket
of
champagne
,
sacramental
,
in
front
of
him
to
greet
the
actresses
as
they
are
shown
in
.
He
has
plenty
of
time
for
these
creatures
.
He
feels
himself
to
be
privileged
.
Casting
enables
him
to
ask
all
sorts
of
personal
questions
,
which
give
him
an
insight
into
the
kind
of
life
that
young
,
beautiful
French
actresses
live
.
In
his
own
way
he
is
something
of
an
expert
on
the
private
lives
of
actresses
.
Young
actresses
dwell
in
a
quandary
.
They
are
strongly
moved
to
express
themselves
outside
the
confines
of
their
lovely
bodies
,
while
,
of
course
,
conscious
that
a
large
part
of
their
appeal
lies
just
there
.
They
are
very
aware
,
too
,
that
what
Letterman
is
presenting
to
them
is
not
just
a
script
and
a
lot
of
money
,
but
an
intimate
relationship
with
himself
.
This
relationship
is
evidently
not
to
be
confused
with
a
sexual
relationship
;
it
is
just
that
once
you
have
entered
into
an
artistic
liaison
of
this
intensity
,
the
sexual
shenanigans
are
likely
to
follow
.
But
young
actresses
in
Paris
have
boyfriends
who
are
successful
composers
,
video
producers
and
photographers
.
Even
the
very
young
in
Paris
are
successful
.
It
is
a
French
talent
.
From
poverty
to
Giorgio
Armani
takes
no
time
at
all
,
and
in
that
brief
time
,
if
there
is
some
uncertainty
and
a
few
wrong
turns
,
they
are
contemplated
over
elaborate
meals
in
good
restaurants
.
So
Letterman
has
to
burnish
his
act
.
He
is
,
of
course
,
holding
a
few
cards
:
this
is
a
movie
with
a
woman
in
the
lead
and
it
will
largely
be
in
English
.
(
Letterman
likes
my
idea
of
using
Maa
and
subtitles
very
much
;
he
was
hoping
I
would
suggest
something
like
that
.
)
It
is
also
a
movie
which
is
likely
to
be
controversial
in
Paris
.
This
appeals
to
the
actresses
he
is
interviewing
.
All
the
actresses
think
that
it
is
vital
that
France
should
,
as
they
say
,
engage
herself
with
the
past
.
Their
analysis
may
not
go
any
deeper
than
that
,
but
it
is
expressed
in
a
way
which
impresses
Letterman
,
a
sort
of
passionate
commitment
to
the
power
of
the
idea
which
he
has
-
subversively
-
been
advocating
in
Hollywood
for
years
.
So
he
says
.
He
mentions
Alain
Resnais
and
Louis
Malle
as
influences
.
There
are
nine
actresses
to
see
in
the
first
run
.
Letterman
closets
himself
with
these
women
all
day
.
Occasionally
he
has
to
call
in
his
assistant
,
a
young
Algerian
Parisian
called
Farwaggi
,
to
translate
,
but
most
of
Farwaggi
's
job
is
to
make
sure
tapes
are
delivered
,
CVs
collected
and
taxis
ordered
.
He
is
expected
to
give
his
opinion
only
when
asked
,
although
even
these
requests
are
tendentious
.
Letterman
likes
him
because
he
is
neither
too
elegant
nor
too
assured
.
In
a
curious
way
-
Letterman
thinks
-
he
bears
the
same
relationship
to
Parisian
life
that
the
Hispanics
have
to
LA
life
.
Letterman
is
a
believer
in
the
immigrant
mentality
.
His
grandparents
were
immigrants
themselves
,
from
Frankfurt
.
His
father
was
born
in
Germany
,
and
a
teenager
when
they
brought
him
to
Detroit
.
They
took
ship
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
way
things
were
going
in
1934
.
Farwaggi
is
also
in
charge
of
ordering
room
service
.
Letterman
likes
to
pander
to
the
actresses
'
wishes
.
Getting
behind
their
personal
defences
is
part
of
his
strategy
.
Farwaggi
,
his
Arab
provenance
showing
in
the
bluish
(
Camus-esque
,
thinks
Letterman
)
stubble
which
grows
stronger
as
the
day
progresses
,
a
gentle
mycological
stain
spreading
on
his
eager
,
almost
good-looking
face
,
spends
all
day
on
the
phone
either
ordering
variations
on
the
club
's
menus
or
rushing
to
and
from
the
fax
office
.
Letterman
's
activities
are
characterized
by
bustle
and
urgency
.
He
is
looking
for
an
easy
rapport
,
but
he
does
not
want
it
to
be
too
easy
.
In
his
mind
's
eye
he
sees
a
girl
who
has
brains
(
although
he
knows
that
some
very
dim
actresses
can
read
with
all
the
appearance
of
intelligence
,
and
the
converse
)
who
has
a
slight
resistance
to
the
Hollywoodification
of
Claudia
's
life
.
He
wants
to
be
able
to
use
her
independence
of
mind
-
"
attitude
"
as
they
say
-
to
advantage
.
He
also
wishes
to
engage
in
a
good
argument
with
her
about
the
nature
of
the
character
.
After
the
opening
pleasantries
-
"
What
have
you
been
doing
?
What
movies
have
you
been
in
recently
?
"
-
he
asks
each
of
them
what
she
knows
about
Claude
Cohn-Casson
.
"
How
would
you
treat
the
question
of
the
collaboration
of
her
countrymen
and
-women
in
her
death
?
"
he
asks
.
"
Because
this
is
something
we
are
still
thinking
about
,
the
extent
to
which
it
should
be
part
of
the
story
.
"
"
France
must
engage
with
her
past
.
"
"
Do
you
think
movies
should
,
in
some
way
,
"
he
says
,
leaning
back
consciously
preparing
himself
to
listen
,
"
start
out
with
this
kind
of
dialectic
?
"
The
French
like
the
word
.
The
Minister
of
Culture
uses
it
when
he
's
in
a
conversational
hole
.
To
Letterman
,
who
was
once
a
fan
of
Marcuse
,
it
is
a
distinctly
toothsome
word
.
In
that
one
word
,
he
sees
,
you
have
a
basic
tenet
of
European
thought
,
namely
that
ideas
are
antagonistic
and
aggressive
.
Ideas
are
like
negative
atoms
-
or
does
he
mean
ions
?
-
rushing
around
attempting
to
resolve
themselves
.
(
Nobody
,
he
has
noted
,
seems
much
interested
in
the
promised
synthesis
.
)
For
ten
hours
he
watches
the
lovely
squirrel
lips
,
the
high
,
paysanne
cheekbones
,
the
smoky
eyes
,
the
darkly
glowing
hair
,
the
nervously
crossed
legs
,
the
langoustine
fingers
,
the
half-risen
,
brioche
breasts
.
This
one
uses
the
word
niveau
,
which
he
does
not
know
,
as
though
it
is
an
English
word
,
one
of
those
border-hopping
words
like
ambience
.
She
is
making
a
distinction
between
parochial
films
and
films
on
a
global
niveau
.
Her
belief
is
that
to
reach
a
very
wide
audience
one
must
establish
character
first
so
the
audience
can
identify
itself
with
the
issue
,
through
the
character
.
This
is
her
opinion
,
anyway
.
She
makes
a
small
,
dismissive
,
explosion
with
her
lips
,
like
a
gentle
fart
.
She
smiles
.
She
knows
his
game
.
There
is
none
of
that
fake
girlishness
that
young
women
employ
in
California
.
If
anything
,
Letterman
thinks
,
these
women
have
a
compulsion
to
reach
a
higher
plane
of
conversation
that
strains
credulity
.
Women
can
"
t
win
,
he
reflects
,
sympathetically
.
He
soon
realizes
that
these
actresses
also
have
a
distinctly
French
notion
of
Hollywood
.
He
sees
that
many
of
the
Hollywood
films
they
admire
have
undergone
a
metamorphosis
in
France
from
straightforward
studio
fare
to
art
.
These
movies
have
been
carrying
,
like
a
sealed
train
,
the
bacillus
of
high
art
.
Letterman
resists
the
temptation
to
sneer
at
what
some
might
consider
pretentiousness
.
He
recognizes
that
this
willingness
to
fillet
the
intellectual
and
thematic
from
even
the
most
ho-hum
work
is
absent
from
the
Anglo-Saxon
world
,
yet
he
also
thinks
that
he
understands
it
because
of
his
own
(
despite
the
tennis
lessons
and
jogging
)
Jewishness
.
Even
Hollywood
's
banalities
and
excesses
have
mythical
appeal
.
Places
like
Malibu
and
Beverly
Hills
glow
in
their
imagination
.
They
want
to
be
degraded
by
the
system
and
die
in
a
pool
of
their
own
vomit
in
a
motel
,
where
rooms
are
rented
by
the
hour
to
cowboys
.
(
This
is
how
he
tells
it
later
after
some
disillusionment
has
set
in
.
)
The
day
has
passed
quickly
.
Despite
the
notes
,
and
the
polaroids
made
by
Farwaggi
in
his
anteroom
,
and
the
trays
of
fruit
,
club
sandwiches
,
croques
and
so
on
-
the
cheerfully
arranged
amuse-gueules
from
the
kitchen
ordered
for
each
girl
-
he
finds
he
is
becoming
confused
about
their
identities
.
Instead
of
seeing
the
person
depicted
on
the
duckpond
surface
of
the
polaroids
,
he
sees
an
amalgam
:
this
one
's
slightly
dark
upper
lip
,
this
one
's
nervy
legs
,
this
one
's
role
in
Le
Medecin
malgre
lui
at
the
Comedie
Francaise
(
where
he
has
recently
sat
through
an
excruciating
evening
of
seventeenth-century
high
camp
)
,
this
one
's
intensely
white
and
brown
eyes
,
this
one
's
professed
love
of
Shakespeare
,
this
one
's
part
in
an
erotic
thriller
(
he
can
remember
her
buttocks
from
that
movie
,
but
he
ca
n't
fix
them
to
the
right
actress
without
his
notes
)
.
It
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
they
have
become
one
.
No
,
he
will
be
able
to
sort
them
out
into
a
short-list
of
three
or
four
for
further
interview
.
But
Claude
Cohn-Casson
has
been
subsumed
by
their
physical
selves
,
right
here
in
the
room
,
as
sexy
as
hell
.
And
the
issues
,
as
he
sees
them
,
have
also
been
hijacked
.
These
French
women
are
in
favour
of
contentious
art
.
But
they
think
that
art
has
a
quite
separate
existence
from
fact
.
They
believe
-
and
he
finds
the
argument
chic
,
too
-
that
art
is
the
final
judgement
.
He
decides
at
this
stage
not
to
ask
any
of
them
to
dinner
.
He
is
not
quite
sure
that
they
would
all
accept
,
but
that
is
not
why
he
holds
back
.
He
feels
,
in
the
light
of
the
subject
matter
and
the
seriousness
of
their
conversations
,
that
he
should
exhibit
some
seriousness
of
purpose
,
although
he
solicits
their
opinions
about
restaurants
to
show
that
he
is
not
all
big
issues
.
But
also
these
young
women
make
him
feel
old
.
Now
he
is
poised
here
in
Paris
,
sipping
a
champagne
so
dry
it
tastes
like
flint
,
on
the
brink
of
old
age
.
He
will
be
fifty
in
a
few
years
"
time
.
He
was
born
almost
as
the
events
of
the
movie
were
taking
place
.
When
they
talk
about
these
matters
and
the
need
to
engage
oneself
with
one
's
history
,
he
realizes
that
"
history
"
is
the
operative
word
.
But
he
understands
.
He
is
cursed
with
this
understanding
.
When
he
was
growing
up
in
Dearborn
there
was
a
succession
of
sad-sack
,
embarrassing
(
to
a
fan
of
Johnny
Unitas
)
,
old-world
relations
with
funny
accents
who
were
constantly
belly-aching
about
the
war
and
-
of
course
-
the
dreadful
death
and
displacement
which
had
taken
place
.
To
him
,
even
then
,
it
had
been
history
,
and
it
somehow
deserved
ill-fortune
;
in
the
heedless
fashion
of
the
American
suburbs
it
seemed
right
to
look
down
on
the
refugees
from
an
old
,
superstition-riven
world
.
So
he
understands
.
They
think
people
were
different
then
.
He
dismisses
Farwaggi
.
It
is
eleven
.
Farwaggi
moves
towards
the
door
,
almost
shuffling
,
a
satrap
by
inheritance
.
He
offers
to
return
at
eight
.
"
I
'll
call
you
,
"
says
Letterman
.
"
I
want
to
think
a
little
first
.
I
'm
playing
tennis
and
then
I
'll
call
you
.
You
done
good
,
kid
.
"
The
idiom
means
nothing
to
him
,
but
he
gets
the
idea
.
He
smiles
shyly
.
"
It
was
okay
?
"
he
asks
.
(
"
Eee
"
-
sudden
swoop
-
"
twashokay
?
"
)
"
Just
great
.
Food
for
thought
.
See
you
tomorrow
.
Not
before
ten
at
the
earliest
.
"
Camus
sets
off
into
the
night
.
This
boy
has
studied
at
film
school
.
He
loves
the
films
of
John
Ford
.
Letterman
thinks
John
Ford
films
are
ponderous
nonsense
.
Particularly
Stagecoach
.
He
runs
a
bath
.
The
day
,
the
expenditure
of
emotion
-
the
oyster
knife
he
has
been
inserting
into
these
women
's
lives
-
have
tired
him
.
He
feels
clammy
.
He
undresses
.
His
body
always
seems
to
bulk
up
after
a
day
like
this
:
he
can
see
increased
sponginess
around
his
waist
and
chest
.
(
One
of
the
cruellest
ironies
of
the
death
camps
is
that
Jews
were
never
meant
to
be
thin
.
)
He
lies
in
the
bath
scented
,
marinated
by
the
little
sachets
and
ampoules
of
emollients
he
has
tipped
into
the
water
.
Not
far
away
is
the
street
where
Claudia
was
brought
up
.
It
inspires
him
to
be
so
close
.
He
has
found
her
house
,
which
overlooks
a
park
.
In
the
park
is
a
children
's
playground
with
a
carousel
.
He
sees
this
movie
now
as
his
own
story
,
his
own
personal
work
.
His
oeuvre
.
He
is
l'auteur
.
I
am
waiting
for
Tom
Fairfax
.
For
an
elderly
man
he
has
a
great
many
demands
on
his
time
.
He
is
a
polo
umpire
,
a
judge
of
horseflesh
,
adviser
to
the
Farmers
'
Union
,
a
stalwart
of
regimental
dinners
and
a
confidant
of
opposition
politicians
.
Letterman
sees
the
role
of
historical
adviser
in
the
way
that
he
sees
the
role
of
writer
,
only
less
so
.
The
historical
adviser
is
there
not
to
ensure
verisimilitude
,
but
to
be
an
accomplice
in
furthering
the
aims
of
the
producer
.
When
I
tell
him
that
Fairfax
seems
to
have
played
a
very
big
part
in
Claudia
's
life
,
he
does
n't
see
any
problem
.
Great
news
,
he
says
.
As
far
as
he
is
concerned
,
nobody
cares
how
accurate
our
portrayal
of
Claudia
's
love
life
is
.
He
cites
Out
of
Africa
.
But
Karen
Blixen
did
not
end
up
in
Auschwitz
,
I
reply
.
We
are
not
making
a
documentary
-
get
him
on
side
if
you
can
.
Fifteen
thousand
for
the
research
.
Mr
Shah
,
although
he
does
not
comment
,
appears
less
concerned
about
my
bill
now
.
Letterman
's
expansive
style
is
getting
to
him
.
But
I
do
n't
bring
up
the
subject
of
money
with
Fairfax
immediately
.
I
ask
him
to
come
down
for
a
few
days
and
I
also
invite
Lady
De
Marr
.
I
offer
to
book
them
into
the
hotel
,
owned
by
an
airline
,
which
carries
on
a
heroic
but
losing
battle
for
French
standards
.
The
hotel
operators
are
only
here
because
of
some
trade-off
between
governments
.
This
has
resulted
in
a
restaurant
which
serves
the
regional
specialities
of
France
to
bemused
locals
.
One
woman
,
a
party
official
's
wife
,
is
said
by
the
Anglican
vicar
to
have
eaten
twenty-one
croustades
of
morels
in
a
sauce
of
cream
and
truffle
,
with
a
vapeur
of
Armagnac
,
in
the
belief
that
she
was
fostering
international
relations
.
(
The
vicar
ate
the
other
four
.
Absolutely
delicious
.
)
But
Fairfax
has
made
his
own
arrangements
.
He
will
be
staying
at
a
coffee
plantation
on
the
edge
of
town
.
Lady
De
Marr
will
not
be
coming
.
Letterman
tells
me
that
casting
in
Paris
is
going
well
.
He
has
a
short
list
.
Candice
Riberon
who
was
in
a
thriller
called
Le
Metro
is
his
favourite
so
far
,
but
there
is
a
long
way
to
go
.
I
have
seen
Metro
.
It
opens
with
a
very
long
sex
scene
in
a
small
apartment
.
On
the
bed
lies
Candice
Riberon
.
For
a
few
agonizing
minutes
the
camera
holds
on
her
face
as
she
experiences
-
she
hardly
seems
to
be
enjoying
-
sexual
attentions
out
of
the
range
of
the
camera
.
Her
face
is
very
mobile
.
Her
eyes
close
,
open
,
close
again
.
Her
lips
move
in
an
anguished
chewing
motion
,
so
that
her
mouth
widens
and
closes
,
a
fevered
sea-urchin
.
Now
the
camera
begins
to
move
down
her
body
,
over
her
breasts
,
which
are
lightly
beaded
(
and
quite
widely
separated
)
although
it
is
hard
to
tell
in
the
chiaroscuro
created
,
as
we
are
soon
to
find
out
,
by
the
shutters
of
the
apartment
.
As
the
camera
moves
down
her
body
,
which
is
undulating
beneath
its
gaze
,
almost
vibrating
,
and
leaves
her
navel
behind
,
it
comes
to
a
dark
,
tousled
shape
,
not
clearly
visible
in
the
low
levels
of
light
.
Immediately
the
audience
believes
-
I
certainly
believed
-
that
somebody
is
eating
her
pussy
.
We
do
not
see
his
face
,
but
we
see
her
hands
clutching
his
head
.
It
is
moving
up
and
down
in
an
ever
increasing
tempo
.
She
climaxes
and
pushes
the
face
away
.
It
is
turned
in
this
action
towards
the
meagre
amount
of
light
,
light
which
has
a
density
and
texture
not
often
seen
in
real
life
,
created
by
filling
the
air
with
smoke
and
piercing
it
with
tungsten
light
.
The
camera
holds
this
face
.
The
eyes
are
open
but
they
are
unseeing
.
There
is
blood
coming
out
of
his
ears
.
The
camera
cuts
to
Candice
,
dressing
.
Her
body
is
boyish
,
her
breasts
quite
full
,
a
very
dark
,
dense
thicket
just
disappearing
as
her
skirt
is
pulled
up
.
The
titles
roll
:
METRO
.
Un
Film
de
Jean-Claude
Reed
.
It
is
a
shocking
scene
,
because
it
starts
by
involving
the
audience
in
its
raw
eroticism
and
then
turns
on
them
,
so
that
they
feel
guilty
for
the
stirrings
they
have
inevitably
been
experiencing
.
After
this
virtuoso
shot
,
the
rest
of
the
film
is
disappointing
,
often
silly
,
but
I
remember
thinking
how
well
Candice
Riberon
handled
the
rather
artificial
dialogue
.
I
remember
,
too
,
her
strangely
spaced
cheekbones
and
severely
cut
hair
.
She
is
a
serial
killer
who
picks
up
men
in
the
Metro
.
I
can
imagine
S.
O.
Letterman
being
drawn
to
her
.
I
try
to
see
her
as
Claudia
.
In
this
movie
she
adopts
a
coldly
dismissive
tone
with
men
-
her
lovers
and
les
flics
-
which
is
supposed
to
be
chic
,
and
she
is
placed
rather
artificially
in
perfectly
arranged
and
photographed
surroundings
.
Her
ostensible
job
is
something
in
advertising
or
public
relations
,
but
this
is
laughable
:
people
are
always
rushing
off
to
catch
planes
or
to
have
showdowns
with
clients
or
engage
in
unmotivated
conspiracies
to
deceive
the
public
.
There
is
something
so
fatally
trivial
about
this
movie
in
its
elevation
of
appearance
over
substance
,
that
I
feel
an
irrational
resistance
to
her
as
Claudia
.
Of
course
I
know
that
movie
actresses
often
can
not
choose
their
roles
.
For
a
start
they
are
in
a
race
against
the
clock
:
by
the
time
they
have
the
clout
to
choose
the
right
roles
,
they
are
too
old
for
them
.
Producers
and
directors
adore
very
young
women
.
Like
the
Masai
,
they
think
you
can
stay
young
by
sleeping
with
young
women
.
The
filming
of
young
actresses
is
a
sexual
act
.
But
I
ca
n't
prevent
myself
thinking
that
the
person
who
is
to
play
Claudia
should
possess
a
clearly
defined
personality
of
her
own
.
This
is
crazy
,
because
I
have
not
yet
been
able
to
decide
what
Claudia
was
like
.
I
want
Fairfax
to
tell
me
,
but
I
do
n't
hold
out
much
hope
.
The
hotel
is
quiet
.
Outside
,
the
cottage
industries
have
taken
a
rest
as
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
settles
heavily
on
the
town
like
an
unwelcome
blanket
.
The
earth
throws
off
the
heat
it
can
not
accommodate
.
As
I
lie
on
my
bed
I
can
feel
it
coming
in
the
window
.
It
is
like
an
open
oven
in
a
kitchen
,
giving
off
gusts
of
heat
.
I
am
almost
asleep
.
I
think
of
Claudia
and
Victoria
and
Candice
and
I
compare
their
facial
motions
in
an
impertinent
fashion
.
Mr
Shah
wakes
me
.
I
am
drained
and
startled
.
The
mountain
outside
is
darkening
.
He
apologizes
and
hands
me
a
note
:
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
is
expecting
me
for
dinner
at
Folly
Farm
.
"
I
am
afraid
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
,
reluctantly
,
that
the
different
people
and
races
of
the
world
were
never
intended
to
meet
.
For
thousands
of
years
,
hundreds
of
thousands
,
they
stuck
to
their
own
backyards
.
When
they
did
run
into
each
other
on
the
borders
of
their
territories
,
they
usually
tried
to
kill
each
other
.
primitive
people
regarded
themselves
as
the
only
humans
.
In
their
languages
they
described
themselves
as
"
the
man
"
or
"
the
human
"
.
The
idea
that
we
ail
belong
to
one
human
family
is
a
relatively
recent
one
.
Of
course
Claudia
believed
it
.
"
Fairfax
and
I
are
sitting
on
the
verandah
at
Folly
Farm
.
He
is
able
to
re-create
his
own
world
wherever
he
goes
.
He
has
no
taste
for
the
new
world
,
either
in
Africa
or
in
Europe
.
He
was
once
a
director
of
the
company
which
owned
this
coffee
estate
,
and
he
seems
to
have
squatter
's
rights
here
for
life
.
The
manager
is
on
holiday
at
the
coast
and
Fairfax
has
seventeen
rooms
and
six
servants
at
his
disposal
.
The
verandah
is
long
and
overgrown
with
climbing
plants
,
which
are
wrapped
around
the
varnished
poles
that
support
the
tin
roof
.
Our
drinks
are
served
on
elephants
'
feet
which
make
good
side-tables
and
were
once
popular
as
souvenirs
.
You
ca
n't
give
them
away
now

"
I
think
"
,
he
says
,
"
that
the
Germans
had
convinced
themselves
that
there
was
something
noble
in
their
quest
to
clean
up
the
world
.
They
were
acting
in
the
interests
of
western
civilization
.
When
I
was
in
Germany
at
the
end
of
the
war
,
I
met
hundreds
of
Germans
who
tried
to
explain
this
to
me
.
They
were
upset
that
their
efforts
had
been
misunderstood
.
It
was
quite
offensive
really
,
particularly
to
me
,
this
desire
for
a
pat
on
the
back
.
"
We
are
edging
nearer

the
subject

far

completely
black
against

The
servant

a
white-coated
padder
trained
for
the
infrequent
appearance
of
people
like

goes
off
on
the
long
march
to
the
kitchens
.
We
sit
here
,
comfortably
wrapped
up
by
the
night
.
I
can
see
that
England
would
be
anathema
to

Here
,
with
his
little
moustache

each
hair
as
thick
as
a
fishing
line
,

his
noble
,
gelid
face
,
he
counts
for
something

would
be
another

person
elbowed
and
nudged
by

of
gratification

serious

these
soothing
ceremonies

a
reticulation
over

day

bombards
the
brandy
with
a
violent
infusion
of
soda
from
the
large
siphon

brandy
releases
its
poisonous
fumes

air

richly
scented

unknown
blooms

Nairobi
.
We
start
with
a
young
man
,
Thomas
Fairfax
,
in
military
khaki
and
flying
jacket
,
climbing
into
his
old
biplane
and
taxiing
down
a
runway
.
He
adjusts
the
flaps
,
zips
up
his
jacket
,
pulls
down
his
goggles
.
The
runway
is
simply
a
strip
of
grass
,
cleared
of
rocks
.
The
plane
lurches
into
motion
.
It
bounces
alarmingly
as
it
gathers
speed
.
A
few
Africans
,
clutching
sticks
and
wearing
skins
,
watch
the
plane
as
it
turns
,
pauses
,
and
then
accelerates
,
leaving
a
cloud
of
dust
.
The
plane
climbs
reluctantly
,
one
set
of
wings
dipping
drunkenly
.
Soon
it
is
passing
over
the
spectacular
Rift
Valley
.
There
is

clearing
stones
from
a
stretch
of
grassland
,
in
the
shadow
of
the
Mountain

large
white
cross
has
been
painted
roughly
on

Claudia
Cohn-Casson

sitting
under

enormous
African
fig
tree
near

at
a
camp
table
spread
with
a

She
has
in
front
of
her
a
typewriter
,
her
recorder

her
notes

A
servant
is
preparing
lunch
on
a
fire
.
Claudia
hears
something
.
She
looks
up
into
the
sky
in
the
direction
of
Ol
Doinyo
Lengai
.
We
catch
sight
of
a
small
plane
circling
the
mountain
.
It
dips
its
wings
in
acknowledgement
of
the
landing
strip
,
and
circles
,
preparing
to
land
.
Claudia
stands
up
.
She
checks
her
appearance
in
a
mirror
hanging
on
a
tree
.
With
her
lower
lip
she
tucks
the
upper
lip
into
her
mouth
for
a
moment
.
She
is
wearing
a
long
fitted
skirt
of
khaki
.
She
adjusts
her
hat
,
a
round
bush
hat
,
and
walks
towards
the
makeshift
landing
strip
.
The
plane
is
taxiing
,
pursued
by
a
group
of
running
Masai
warriors
,
glorious
in
their
red
and
purple
robes
,
ochred
hair
,
lion
head-dresses
and
so
on
.
Claudia
walks
over
towards
the
plane
.
She
holds
her
hat
on
her
head
with
one
hand
.
The
plane
is
still
now
,
surrounded
by
the
warriors
.
Fairfax
is
securing
its
wheels
with
rocks
.
He
looks
up
to
see
her
approaching
.
Behind
her
is
Ol
Doinyo
Lengai
.
Its
strange
shape
has
become
familiar
to
us
.
His
face
is
still
dirty
from
the
dust
and
oil
,
except
that
around
his
eyes
is
a
white
patch
where
the
goggles
were
.
The
Masai
begin
to
sing
.
It
is
a
strange
,
other-worldly
noise
.
Claudia
and
Fairfax
approach
each
other
.
The
moment
is
unnaturally
,
poignantly
,
delayed
.
In
his
uniform
,
jacket
unzipped
,
he
is
handsome
and
smiling
.
The
singing
of
the
Masai
and
the
overwhelming
landscape
are
thrilling
.
Claudia
and
Fairfax
come
closer
.
She
is
serene
.
He
is
perhaps
surprised
by
her
composure

times

Yes

The

Tepilit
,
is
from
this
district
.
These
people
are
from
his
engang
.
He
was
supposed
to
deliver
a
bull
to
the
district
officer
,
it
was
about
three
weeks
ago
,
and
he
decided
at
the
last
moment
to
replace
the
bull
with
another
one
.
But
the
district
officer
,
Miles
Turnbull
,
would
not
accept
it
-
"
Her
face
,
as
she
removes
her
hat
and
begins
to
speak
,
is
startlingly
beautiful
,
although
not
conventionally
.
Fairfax
watches
her
.
As
she
talks
the
servant
brings
the
drinks
and
then
the
lunch
,
a
grilled
fowl
with
some
preserves
.
As
she
speaks
we
see
a
Masai
market
.
Spread
around
are
hundreds
of
Masai
men
and
women
.
Some
of
the
women
are
in
robes
of
blue
,
others
are
in
brown
,
dyed
skins
.
The
older
men
have
blankets
loosely
slung
over
their
shoulders
.
Almost
every
man
is
accompanied
by
a
goat
or
a
cow
,
held
on
a
short
leather
thong
or
controlled
by
a
thin
stick
.
Those
animals
are
accustomed
to
the
Masai
.
There
is
,
incongruously
,
an
open
car
to
one
side
of
the
market
.
From
it
,
into
the
colourful
throng
,
appears
a
young
British
district
officer
,
Miles
Turnbull
.
He
is
carrying
some
papers
and
is
accompanied
by
two
askaris
with
rifles
,
and
an
interpreter
,
dressed
in
khakis
.
The
askaris
wear
military

The
whole
thing
was
ridiculous
and
tragic
.
This
man
was
very
much
liked
by
the
Masai
.
But
he
was
overworked
.
He
had
to
collect
the
cattle
and
make
sure
that
every
boma
was
contributing
his
fair
share

nearly
one

fifty
miles

liked
him

though
he
was
a
little
bit
boring
.
He
was
so
English
.
He
could
not
speak
Masai
so
he
always
was
accompanied
by
this
man

a

The
young
warrior
,
Tepilit
,
is
arguing
with
the
district
officer
.
He
is
still
vividly
scarred
from
his
recent
encounter
with
a
lion
.
His
face
is
painted
and
he
is
carrying
a
spear
.
On
his
head
he
wears
a
head-dress
of
lion
mane

Turnbull
explains
through
the
interpreter
that
time
is
short
;
it
is
late
;
there
is
a
great
war
on
with
the
Germans
.
He
can
not
wait
for
the
proposed
exchange
of
animals
.
But
he
tries
to
be
reasonable

The
Masai
warrior
,
Tepilit
,
is
excited
.
A
number
of
other
Masai
gather
round
.
He
says
that
this
particular
animal
is
a
favourite
.
He
strokes
its
side
,
which
is
white
and
marked
with
round
patches
of
black
,
like
islands
on
a
naively
drawn
map

It
is
a
beautiful
animal
,
with
huge
,
curved
horns
.

Turnbull
busies
himself
with
his
clipboard
as
his
reply
is
translated
.
"
Take
the
animal

he
says
to
his
assistant
gently
.
As
they
move
forward
,
Tepilit
,
without
warning
,
hurls
his
spear
at
the
district
officer
from
a
few
feet
away
.
It
is
a
heavy
weapon
.
Between
the
knife-shaped
iron
blade
and
the
tapered
tail
of
the
spear
is
a
rounded
handle
made
from
a
particularly
hard
tree
.
This
piece
of
wood
passes
right
through
Turnbull
,
so
that
he
is
skewered
.
A
fountain
of
blood
at
first
pours
from
his
chest
,
but
soon
subsides
to
become
a
steady
trickle

Tepilit
watches
as
the
district
officer
performs
a
brief
hokey-cokey
before
falling
face
down
.
This
drives
the
spear
almost
completely
through
his
body
.
Nobody
moves
.
The
watching
Masai
begin
to
walk
away
after
a
long
,
contemplative
moment

seem
to
be
weighing
the
incident
carefully
in
their
minds
.
The
askaris
panic
.
They
cock
their
rifles
and
fire
into
the
air
.
Now
they
guard
the
body
,
which
is
motionless
in
a
lake
of
blood
that
is
rapidly
drying
,
drunk
by
the
thirsty
,
insatiable
soil
.
You
can
almost
hear
the
soil
gulping

Tepilit
drives
his
bull
away
.
He
walks
without
a
backward
glance
.
He
has
in
one
hand
a
stick
and
is
followed
by

thin
dog

You
know
,
that
is
an
impossible
question

In
one
way
I
loved
them
all
.
I
have
lived
here
for
nearly
five
years
.
Sometimes
for
many
months
I
was
the
only
white
person
for
hundreds
of
miles
.
I
was
very
grateful
to
him
.
I
was
guilty
because
he
was
nearly
killed
.
Another
man
was
killed
in
the
ridiculous
filming
.
I
believed
I
owed
him
some
debt
.
That
boy
will
do
anything
for
me
,
even
up
to
getting
himself
killed
by
a
lion
.
So
I
loved
him
.
Yes
,
I
loved
him
,
but
I
loved
him
in
my
Masai
self
.
Do
you
understand
me
?
Do
you
know
what
my
professor
said
?
He
said
that
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
,
I
mean
our
world
,
is
to
live
la
vraie
vie
.
I
believed
I
was
the
first
anthropologist
in
France
to
understand
what
this
means
.
I
was
trying
to
live
the
real
Masai
life
.
"
"
Is
that
possible
?
"
"
Obviously
not
.
But
at
least
I
was
not
trying
to
stand
completely
outside
this
life
with
my
little
notebook
.
I
ca
n't
leave
this
district
with
one
man
hanged
and
another
killed

somehow
because
of
me
.
I
ca
n't

life
would
be
finished

S.
O.
Letterman
has
rented
a
small
apartment
in
the
rue
de
Beaune
.
It
is
above
a
traiteur
and
as
he
makes
love
with
Candice
Riberon
,
they
are
bathed
,
marinated
and
feted
by
the
scents
of
the
food
from
below
.
At
the
back
is
a
school
where
small
,
elegant
children
play
in
a
courtyard
.
Candice
has
a
husband
who
is
a
physician
at
the
hospital
in
Montparnasse
.
She
makes
love
with
her
eyes
closed
as
though
she
is
trying
not
to
look
at
him
.
Her
lips
move
constantly
,
as
if
she
were
remembering
a
text
,
like
a
Hasid
at
prayer
.
Letterman
thinks
that
he
is
failing
in
love
with
her
but
he
has
the
impression
that
she
is
using
his
cosseted
and
lineamented
body
in
some
sinister
fashion
.
He
thinks
of
that
great
opening
shot
in
Le
Metro
and
he
realizes
that
her
lips
are
moving
in
exactly
the
same
way
,
her
face
pained
as
he
does
his
practised
best
.
He
congratulates
himself
,
however
,
on
auditioning
successfully
for
a
part
in
this
Parisian
cinema
.
Since
he
has
offered
her
the
role
of
Claudia
Cohn-Casson
,
she
has
introduced
him
to
journalists
,
script
writers
and
directors
.
But
this
world
is
kept
separate
from
their
lunchtime
encounters
in
the
rue
de
Beaune
.
She
makes
no
acknowledgement
of
their
affair
in
public
and
he
understands
that
he
is
not
to
refer
to
it
with
these
new
acquaintances
.
(
He
thinks
of
Marlon
Brando
in
Last
Tango
.
)
There
is
a
brutality
about
her
love-making
.
Her
feral
body
takes
its
own
route
,
grinding
,
convulsing
,
swallowing
.
She
ends
up
sitting
on
him
,
facing
the
small
window
from
where
the
children
can
now
be
heard
playing
,
so
that
ail
he
can
see
is
her
lean
and
sculpted
back
,
the
ridge
of
her
spine
showing
like
knuckles
on
a
fist
.
He
fears
,
as
this
moving
tableau
blots
out
his
view
,
that
she
does
not
want
to
look
at
him
but
,
then
,
just
as
he
is
allowing
himself
this
painful
thought
,
she
turns
and
kisses
him
on
the
eyes
before
taking
his
cock
in
her
mouth
.
(
He
is
sometimes
disturbed
by
the
readiness
of
young
women
to
do
this
;
perhaps
it
is
a
dietary
taboo
surfacing
from
his
past
.
)
All
the
time
she
is
in
a
mindless
frenzy
,
he
is
thinking
,
comparing
,
and
second-guessing
.
He
is
cursed
with
this
evaluative
frame
of
mind
.
He
wonders
in
how
many
of
the
little
windows
in
all
the
voguishly
crumbling
buildings
beneath
all
the
Mansard
roofs
,
sex
is
taking
place
.
He
asks
himself
how
many
of
these
encounters
can
be
as
tricky
as
his
own
,
with
the
gorgeous
actress
,
Candice
Riberon
.
In
Paris
,
he
is
certain
,
there
is
a
level
of
sophistication
about
sex
absent
in
Hollywood
.
Yet
sometimes
he
feels
nostalgic
for
the
Californian
variety
,
just
as
an
honest
man
dining
in
the
Tour
d'Argent
can
decently
long
for
a
cheeseburger
.
But
this
little
flat
is
magical
.
Farwaggi
found
it
in
the
Herald
Tribune
.
It
belongs
to
a
journalist
absent
in
Eastern
Europe
,
and
is
really
just
a
large
closet
with
a
marble
fireplace
and
a
tiny
bedroom
and
a
bathroom
where
Candice
sits
across
the
bidet
unembarrassed
,
much
as
she
sits
across
his
body
.
He
has
two
or
three
bidets
in
his
house
in
Beverly
Hills
,
but
he
has
never
seen
them
used
in
this
way
,
with
gusto
.
There
was
a
vogue
for
bidets
in
California
some
years
ago
but
he
thinks
they
are
primarily
symbolic
as
jacuzzis
have
become
.
As
soon
as
he
sets
foot
on
the
elaborate
stairway
which
rises
three
floors
from
the
dark
hall
,
itself
leading
off
a
gloomy
cobbled
courtyard
,
he
has
the
feeling
that
he
is
leaving
for
a
blessed
hour
or
two
his
insubstantial
world
.
(
There
are
many
sneering
adjectives
:
plastic
,
cardboard
,
artificial
,
disposable
,
tinsel
,
polystyrene
,
cut-out
.
)
Yet
he
has
an
instinct
that
this
synthetic
world
is
more
in
tune
with
the
way
things
are
going
in
the
hierarchy
of
ideas
,
than
the
Parisian
world
of
half-wild
ducks
cooked
in
their
own
jus
and
ideas
located
on
different
niveaux
.
(
He
now
knows
what
it
means
.
)
These
ideas
have
,
anyway
,
suffered
a
gallicization
,
which
places
the
French
at
the
centre
of
the
cosmos
.
On
a
more
parochial
level
,
his
mother
adopted
a
similar
approach
:
Eisenhower
was
responsible
,
in
her
estimation
,
for
causing
her
to
have
her
hair
bobbed
.
She
blamed
him
personally
.
Letterman
has
forgotten
the
exact
circumstances
.
He
finds
,
in
talking
to
Candice
's
friends
,
that
collaboration
during
the
war
has
become
for
them
either
a
means
of
attacking
the
government
or
a
subject
of
high-minded
discussion
.
The
intellos
do
not
see
themselves
as
in
any
way
related
to
the
past
.
They
operate
on
a
different
plane
altogether
.
This
is
their
job
.
When
they
have
made
love
-
it
is
unbearably
intense
for
him
-
clouds
scud
across
Candice
's
eyes
.
She
does
not
see
him
at
all
.
He
is
troubled
for
two
reasons
.
The
first
is
that
he
has
got
her
into
bed
so
easily
and
the
second
is
that
it
seems
to
mean
nothing
to
her
.
Perhaps
the
two
worries
are
related
.
Although
she
obviously
enjoys
the
physical
stuff
,
he
would
like
her
to
bring
some
spiritual
qualities
to
the
performance
.
These
are
absent
,
saved
for
conversation
in
restaurants
where
she
talks
with
great
animation
,
but
on
a
plane
which
seems
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
sexual
avidity
.
He
is
,
he
thinks
,
some
sort
of
sexual
experiment
for
her
.
Sex
is
part
of
her
embrace
of
an
exotic
culture
;
it
goes
with
the
territory
,
as
they
say
.
She
returns
from
the
bidet
and
dresses
quickly
.
where
he
has
so
recently
expended
himself
,
disappear
beneath
her
skirt
,
pulled
down
in
one
deft
movement
.
Thinking
cinematically
-
there
is
,
he
believes
,
a
whole
philosophic
category
of
filmic
vision
-
he
sees
the
moment
played
in
close-up
:
the
camera
moving
slowly
up
her
beautiful
legs
,
brown
and
restive
,
reaching
this
little
mysterious
delta
just
as
the
short
,
dense
skirt
descends
.
"
We
must
eat
,
"
she
says
.
She
turns
her
back
to
him
to
look
in
the
mirror
beside
the
cherrywood
armoire
.
He
sees
her
narrow
hips
,
her
lean
back
,
her
lustrous
hair
,
and
over
her
shoulder
in
the
mirror
her
lips
making
quick
whore
's
movements
to
spread
the
lipstick
evenly
.
"
Sure
.
Let's
eat
.
You
've
got
some
appetite
.
Then
I
got
to
get
back
to
work
.
You
look
beautiful
.
"
She
turns
towards
him
briefly
and
she
smiles
,
her
famous
smile
piercing
him
.
She
laughs
now
as
he
bounds
off
the
bed
,
aware
that
his
hairy
-
poilu
-
parts
are
comical
.
He
showers
.
A
bidet
is
not
sufficient
to
remove
the
tinctures
that
must
be
clinging
visibly
to
him
.
They
make
their
way
down
through
the
courtyard
past
the
concierge
's
busy-lizzies
and
geraniums
in
their
cluster
of
terracotta
and
out
onto
the
street
where
the
Mercedes
and
driver
are
double-parked
squeezing
the
traffic
to
an
irascible
trickle
.
Candice
likes
this
conspicuous
consumption
.
She
slumps
,
her
legs
sprawled
,
as
they
inch
out
into
the
traffic
,
heading
for
a
place
which
serves
Gascon
specialities
.
The
Gascons
favour
the
goose
and
its
by-products
.
He
looks
at
Candice
and
she
puckers
her
lips
,
perhaps
ironically
.
By
casting
her
,
one
of
the
hottest
young
actresses
in
France
,
he
has
laid
the
ground
bait
.
He
is
working
the
trade
press
both
in
Europe
and
the
US
.
Soon
he
will
talk
to
local
producers
about
taking
a
share
,
but
for
the
moment
he
is
holding
them
off
.
The
script
comes
next
.
He
has
sent
off
some
ideas
to
Africa
for
inclusion
in
the
first
draft
,
which
should
be
ready
in
about
ten
days
.
He
knows
it
will
need
work
.
The
manager
and
waiters
treat
them
to
a
respectful
embalming
.
He
orders
ravioli
with
foie
gras
and
white
truffle
shavings
.
The
ravioli
are
huge
,
like
saucers
,
each
one
stuffed
with
the
exquisite
mixture
.
Around
him
,
knowing
people
,
people
who
were
born
eating
this
stuff
,
are
conversing
in
that
world-weary
but
photogenic
way
.
He
tries
to
remember
accurately
Flaubert
,
which
he
was
combing
on
the
plane
:
"
Their
indifferent
glances
told
him
of
passion
dulled
by
daily
satisfaction
.
"
Candice
is
eating
a
dish
of
beans
and
preserved
goose
.
He
will
never
feel
at
ease
with
the
French
:
he
will
never
wear
the
right
clothes
;
he
will
never
feel
healthy
on
goose
and
red
wine
and
he
no
longer
wants
to
try
.
Yet
he
admires
them
.
He
imagines
that
his
own
family
might
have
had
this
ease
in
the
bourgeois
world
before
they
left
Europe
.
But
for
all
his
misgivings
,
here
he
is
with
one
of
the
most
desirable
women
in
France
eating
truffle
shavings
and
half
an
hour
ago
they
were
lying
on
a
bed
together
.
Still
,
he
feels
that
the
waiters
know
that
he
comes
from
Dearborn
and
they
can
see
that
in
his
cashmere
tweed
jacket
he
is
sailing
under
false
colours
.
He
looks
at
Candice
:
a
tiny
globule
of
goose
fat
is
glistening
on
her
upper
lip
.
He
wonders
if
she
has
told
her
husband
the
docteur
-
he
imagines
a
cheerful
Depardieu
in
a
white
coat
-
of
the
steps
she
has
been
obliged
to
take
in
order
to
get
the
part
.
"
You

liver
?
"
she
asks
.
She
pronounces
"
liver
"
with
a
long
vowel
,
so
that
for
a
second
he
thinks
she
is
asking
if
he
likes
geese
saliva
.
"

he
drops
his
voice
-
"
apart
from
your
pussy
.
"
She
looks
round
in
mock
horror
.
She
laughs
.
His
tired
heart
bounds
.
He
thinks
-
Jesus
,
he
is
so
suburban
-
of
a
tennis
ball
bouncing
off
the
court
.
He
looks
at
her
and
he
can
see
-
in
her
dark
hair
,
her
quite
high
forehead
,
her
wide
,
generously
made
mouth
(
oiled
and
glistening
)
,
her
intensely
brown

No

about
it
.
It
is
dawn
.
The
first
rays
of
the
sun
are
just
touching
the
summit
of
the
Mountain
of
God
.
In
a
cleft
in
the
escarpment
beside
a
stream
is
a
camp
of
a
few
tents
.
There
is
also
a
hut
with
a
thatched
roof
and
beside
it
a
store
room
of
split
poles
.
The
main
tent
stands
near
the
stream
away
from
the
others
.
It
has
a
thatched
roof
over
it
.
It
is
open
on
one
side
to
the
view
of
the
mountain
across
the
valley
.
Seen
through
the
mosquito
netting
are
Tom
Fairfax
and
Claudia
Cohn-Casson
.
She
lies
asleep
on
her
bed
,
which
is
draped
in
a
mosquito
net
,
now
tied
back
.
Fairfax
leaves
the
tent
and
walks
over
to
the
fire
.
He
starts
to
rearrange
the
still-smouldering
logs
,
fanning
them
into
flame
.
He
places
some
more
logs
from
a
pile
near
by
onto
the
fire
and
pushes
an
old
,
blackened
kettle
into
the
middle
of
the
newly
revived
flames
.
He
rubs
his
hands
.
It
is
still
quite
dark
in
the
tent
.
Claudia
opens
her
eyes
.
They
are
greeted
by
the
magnificent
vista
of
the
plain
and
the
strange
,
but
familiar
,
shape
of
Ol
Doinyo
Lengai
,
which
is
steadily
catching
fire
at
its
summit
as
the
sun
rises
.
She
is
naked
and
makes
no
attempt
to
cover
any
more
of
herself
than
people
do
who
are
all
alone
.
Fairfax
returns
with
two
enamel
mugs
and
a
brown
teapot
on
a
tray
.
He
passes
her
a
cup
.
Outside
the
sunlight
has
raced
down
the
slope
of
the
mountain
and
has
almost
reached
the
floor
of
the
valley
.
"

he
says
,
placing
her
tea

the

She

her

adjust
to
a
new

tardily

Outside
cowbells
can
be
heard
and
in
the
distance
a
group
of
Masai
enters
the
landscape
driving
their
animals
;
despite
the
fierce
colours
of
their

completely
at

In

the
Masai

Tepilit

on
the

roused
by
the
sergeant
,
accompanied
by
armed
askaris
.
When
he
stands
up
he
is
handcuffed
.
The
handcuffs
are
cumbersome
,
perhaps
little
used

it
takes
an
askari
a
long
time
to
adjust
them

Tepilit
's

Tepilit

out

They
rise
and
walk
back
down
the
valley
.
In
the
distance
over
the
mountain
,
thunder
sounds
.
The
noise
is
like
kindling
crackling
.
On
the
landing
strip
,
Fairfax
says
goodbye
to
Claudia
,
who
stands
,
subdued
but
beautiful
,
at
a
short
distance
from
the

Masai
look
on

There
is
lightning
in
the

Fairfax
walks
to
the

.
He
removes
the
chocks
and
starts
the
plane
by
hand
.
Claudia
's
face
is
obscured
by
the
dust
which
rises
.
Soon
we
see
the
plane
bumping
along
the
runway
.
Fairfax
waves
.
The
plane
rises
unsteadily
into
the
air
.
Claudia
's
brown
eyes
well
with
tears
.
She
stands
for
a
long
moment
.
A
twisted
filament
of
lightning
signals
a
constriction
of
the
atmosphere
.
It
is
accompanied
by
the
distant
rise
of
Masai
singing
.
In
this
landscape
she
seems
,
despite
the
onlookers
,
completely
lost
.
We
fear
for
her
.
She
turns
back
towards
her
camp
.
We
hear
the
distant
-
and
growing
more
distant
-
engine
of
the
plane
,
a
whine
underlaid
by
an
occasional
choking
sob

A
small
Masai
boy
,
carrying
two
whittled
sticks
,
joins
her
and
they
walk
together

The
moment
is
poignant

The

In

Indian

a

fast

You

was
precious

we
were
in

I
find
it
hard
to
say
,
because
it
seems
so
inadequate
to
describe
what
we
felt
.
But
,
yes
,
the
truth
is
we
were
madly
in
love
.
"
Here
we
sit
.
The
tin
roof
of
the
verandah
is
home
to
all
sorts
of
creatures
.
Newcomers
to
Africa
find
this
constant
primitive
motion
disturbing
.
Insects
lurch
and
stagger
and
scramble
.
Lizards
dart
and
pause
,
treachery
in
their
Iago
eyes
.
Small
vertebrates
lurk
and
pounce
in
the
bushes

Giant
moths
flap
into
lights

They
are
like
scraps
from
a
tailor
's
cutting
room

have
taken
clumsy
wing

the

hours
Fairfax
has
spent

drink

insect-bombarded

one

those
impossible

noughts

the
number
of
light

a
moment

He
is
rearranging
his
thoughts
like
a
man
trying
to
move
heavy
furniture
single-handed

He
is
perplexed
by
the
idea
of
effortless
intercontinental
telephoning
and
overnight
shipment

a
world
where
the
simplest
transactions

phone
calls
,
postal
services
,
pensions
,
come
in
a
miasma
of
suspicion
and
scepticism
.
The
essence
of
the
capitalist
system
is
the
knowledge
that
these
basic
services
are
simple
and
their
outcome
sure
.
This
is
why
Russia
will
never
become
a
western
democracy

The
democracy
is
the
product
of
a
western
mind
,
not
the
other
way
round

The
elderly
mercantile
brother
in
Montreal
was
bluff

cheerful

His
French
accent
had
been

that
he
sounded

twelve

fifty
different

bacilli

medical
experiments

suit
.
The
water
for
my
shower
is
scented
with
wood-ash
.
It
has
been
heated
outside
the
room
by
a
log
fire
under
a
petrol
drum
.
Fairfax
is
seated
in
the
dining
room
beneath
the
stuffed
heads
of
a
cabal
of
gloomy
animals
as
he
eats
sausages
and
eggs
.
In
his
world
these
fixed
points
must
be
observed
,
if
only
because
the
servants
expect
them
.
We
set
off
in
my
Toyota
down
the
now
familiar
road
,
past
the
police
Training
Centre
,
where
motorcycling
policemen
were
once
taught
to
do
multiple
handstands
on
BSA
motorcycles
,
past
the
Firewood
project
,
a
scheme
to
plant
a
fast-growing
species
of
tree
,
now
abandoned
,
down
the
long
,
straight
,
rutted
road
lined
with
workshops
,
past
the
ruined
dairy
farm
,
past
more
shacks
which
are
alive
with
banana
sellers
,
wood
choppers
,
and
maize
roasters
.
Soon
we
are
out
on
the
savannah
leaving
behind
the
rain
shadow
of
the
mountain
.
But
rain
has
fallen
here
,
too
,
in
that
arbitrary
way
which
makes
life
so
unpredictable
.
The
brown
of
the
plains
has
been
replaced
by
an
underlying
green
,
like
the
velvet
on
a
stag
's
antlers
.
Fairfax
has
n't
been
this
way
for
twenty
years
.
He
tells
me
that
there
were
once
herds
of
antelope
,
thousands
strong
,
roaming
these
plains
.
Everything
he
tells
me
of
former
times
is
suffused
with
loss
.
The
sense
of
space
is
an
illusion
.
Every
inch
of
these
plains
is
grazed
daily
.
The
bush
,
the
wilderness
,
was
a
state
of
mind
which
was
banished
once
boundaries
and
limits
were
recognized
.
"
You
told
me
"
,
I
say
as
we
bounce
along
the
ever-dwindling
road
,
"
that
you
thought
of
marrying
Lady
De
Marr
.
Have
you
ever
been
married
?
"
"
I
was
actually
married
when
I
was
with
Claudia
.
My
wife
was
in
Devon
at
her
father
's
.
We
were
divorced
in
"
forty-seven
.
And
then
six
or
seven
years
later
I
married
again
,
but
she
died
in
nineteen
seventy-three
.
I
have
n't
been
married
since
.
"
Although
age
has
made
its
inroads
,
I
can
see
that
Fairfax
has
the
mark
of
a
man
who
is
attractive
to
women
.
He
has
the
assurance
conveyed
by
a
lifetime
of
being
admired
.
This
is
an
embalming
process
.
It
reminds
me
of
those
handsome
bottles
of
fruit
at
Fauchon
,
their
shape
and
colour
not
only
preserved
but
given
lustre
by
the
amber
syrup
they
bathe
in
.
Even
here
in
the
dusty
,
bounding
Toyota
,
this
old
man
has
a
distinctiveness
,
the
clubbable
,
dependable
qualities
of
what
used
to
be
called
a
gentleman
.
As
we
travel
,
the
frozen
side
of
his
face
is
turned
from
me
.
I
see
only
the
seal
profile
,
the
rounded
and
compressed
nose
,
one
brown
and
masked
eye
.
His
skin
in
this
brutal
morning
light
is
textured
and
darkened
by
a
weft
of
tiny
arterial
threads
,
some
almost
blue
.
The
effect
is
noble
,
an
honourably
acquired
patina
.
"
Back
in
nineteen
forty-four
when
Claudia
was
working
on
her
thesis
,
I
understood
intellectually
"
-
he
says
the
word
with
a
certain
fastidiousness
-
"
what
she
was
saying
about
the
Masai
,
but
as
a
man
who
knew
the
country
and
the
natives
,
or
thought
I
did
,
I
could
n't
really
accept
it
.
Their
customs
seemed
to
me
to
be
too
flimsy
.
She
wanted
me
to
believe
that
there
was
a
relation
to
a
universal
spirit
.
It
seemed
a
very
artificial
idea
.
After
I
got
back
to
civilian
life
,
I
fell
back
into
the
habit
of
admiring
the
Masai
,
but
regarding
them
as
insubstantial
.
Now
I
am
not
so
sure
.
Did
I
tell
you
that
I
was
at
Belsen
just
after
it
was
liberated
?
"
"
No
.
Good
God
.
"
"
Two
days
after
.
I
was
looking
for
Claudia
.
"
They
were
n't
there
.
"
"
No
.
We
did
n't
know
that
,
but
I
thought
I
could
find
her
.
I
had
a
mad
idea
that
she
would
be
there
.
That
's
where
my
regiment
was
sent
.
When
I
got
there
our
chaps
were
burying
the
bodies
with
bulldozers
.
I
tried
to
make
some
enquiries
.
"
In
the
pictures
of
Belsen
,
the
sheer
anguish
on
the
faces
of
the
Tommies
contrasts
starkly
with
the
indifference
of
the
SS
recorded
in
their
cheery
souvenir
albums
.
After
a
few
hours
'
driving
,
we
stop
by
a
small
lake
brimming
with
clear
water
which
has
tumbled
down
from
the
escarpment
through
dense
forest
.
Fairfax
's
steward
has
packed
sandwiches
for
us
and
an
ancient
vacuum
flask
of
tea
.
Vervet
monkeys
with
their
anxious
faces
come
closer
to
look
at
us
.
They
chivvy
and
reproach
each
other
as
we
eat
.
We
find
the
laibon
in
the
late
afternoon
.
He
shows
no
surprise
that
Fairfax
has
come
to
pay
his
respects
after
nearly
fifty
years
.
They
shake
hands
in
an
unhurried
fashion
and
exchange
the
courtesies
.
The
laibon
goes
off
for
a
moment
and
returns
wearing
his
cloak
as
the
old
lady
produces
some
stools
.
We
sit
in
the
boma
,
the
place
de
l'Etoile
of
Masai
life
.
Radiating
outwards
are
the
paths
to
the
pastures
and
the
frontiers
of
the
Masai
world
.
When
I
sit
here
with
the
laibon
and
his
family
I
feel
envious
of
their
flimsy
values
.
I
am
running
my
tape-recorder
as
they
talk
.
They
are
too
old
to
be
worried
about
the
physical
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
them
,
but
I
also
see
that
they
share
a
certain
self-regard
,
a
comfort
which
-
I
hazard
a
speculation
-
is
robbed
from
old
people
in
our
cities
.
These
old
chaps
have
some
substance
in
the
universe
.
Sure
,
they
are
soon
going
off
into
the
night
,
their
lights
flickering
and
fading
,
but
it
will
be
with
dignity
.
And
yet
dignity
is
a
synthetic
property
,
invented
to
stop
the
ears
against
the
noises
of
humiliation
.
Their
conversation
starts
slowly
and
in
ritual
fashion
.
I
am
just
able
to
discern
the
formalities
which
are
like
the
horns
of
ships
circling
in
the
fog
to
dock
.
Fairfax
is
in
no
hurry
.
His
Maa
is
,
as
far
as
I
can
tell
,
fluent
and
unaccented
.
He
seems
transformed
,
as
though
he
is
speaking
in
tongues
.
He
has
taken
on
a
personality
,
like
those
crackpots
who
claim
to
have
been
reincarnated
,
from
another
culture
.
He
inclines
his
head
in
a
way
I
have
not
seen
.
He
issues
long
,
philosophic
vowel
sounds
:
"
eehh
;
aaie
;
eh-eh
;
hooh
"
,
and
clicks
of
the
tongue
and
palate
like
plastic
cutlery
rattling
.
The
laibon
now
begins
to
unburden
himself
.
It
is
his
boma
and
his
forum
.
The
koko
serves
us
tea
respectfully
,
although
she
smiles
at
me
complicitly
as
she
hands
me
my
mug
.
Her
ears
are
so
stretched
by
ornaments
that
they
flap
as
she
leans
towards
me
.
From
her
rises
that
familiar
scent
which
I
take
to
be
human
.
These
two
men
and
the
koko
knew
Claudia
.
It
seems
to
me
almost
inconceivable
that
they
could
all
have
survived
Africa
.
The
old
lady
would
have
been
a
lissome
girl
,
like
the
girls
now
coming
through
the
main
entrance
of
the
boma
,
carrying
large
plastic
containers
of
water
on
their
heads
,
keeping
them
in
place
by
a
casual
touch
of
the
hand
.
(
I
know
these
girls
;
they
are
the
new
wives
of
two
of
the
laibon
's
elder
sons
.
They
have
both
been
to
school
and
like
to
speak
their
few
words
of
English
when
their
elders
are
not
looking
.
)
Fairfax
turns
to
me
:
"
The
laibon
is
telling
me
about
the
lion
hunt
in
which
his
brother
was
injured
.
"
"
Did
Claudia
tell
you
the
story
?
"
"
I
think
she
did
.
"
The
laibon
is
gesturing
.
He
stands
up
and
mimes
throwing
a
spear
.
It
is
a
stiff
movement
(
as
crabbed
as
Letterman
's
second
serve
)
but
children
gather
to
watch
.
I
look
at
Fairfax
.
He
nods
frequently
and
issues
his
vowel
noises
in
harmony
with
the
narrative
.
He
and
the
laibon
laugh
loudly
,
which
causes
the
laibon
to
cough
.
The
children
,
who
stand
in
a
small
cluster
near
the
goat
enclosure
,
now
look
at
each
other
and
laugh
,
too
,
but
when
the
laibon
swings
his
impressive
,
lidded
gaze
towards
them
,
they
freeze
.
He
swats
the
side
of
his
head
with
one
of
his
large
hands
and
sits
down
again
.
At
least
half
an
hour
goes
by
before
the
laibon
breaks
off
to
welcome
the
returning
cattle
.
We
have
heard
them
for
some
time
;
now
we
see
them
,
red
and
white
on
the
green
of
the
plains
.
What
a
change
.
They
have
somehow
,
in
the
few
days
since
the
rains
arrived
,
become
biblically
sleek
.
Their
flanks
wobble
and
their
eyes
are
moist
and
content
.
The
warriors
have
been
with
them
because
lions
have
been
seen
in
the
area
where
they
were
grazing
.
"
He
's
a
nice
old
boy
,
"
says
Fairfax
as
we
watch
the
laibon
counting
in
his
cattle
.
"
He
has
problems
with
his
family
,
like
most
old
people
.
He
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
the
government
has
not
yet
sent
the
compensation
.
He
wonders
if
you
filled
in
the
forms
correctly
.
"
He
laughs
,
a
short
,
merry
bark
.
"
Do
n't
expect
gratitude
from
these
buggers
,
"
he
says
.
The
women
and
children
take
charge
of
the
cattle
's
night-time
arrangements
,
gently
guiding
and
scolding
them
.
The
tion
.
The
warriors
gaze
steadily
and
silently
at
Fairfax
.
I
wonder
how
much
they
know
about
their
parents
and
grandparents
.
One
boy
I
have
not
seen
before
has
the
perfect
Masai
physique
,
tall
and
slender
but
muscular
like
a
high
jumper
's
.
His
face
is
arranged
in
planes
and
his
long
hair
is
oiled
and
ochred
.
Fairfax
tells
me
that
he
is
a
suitor
,
eager
to
lay
claim
to
a
girl
who
is
now
only
eleven
.
He
is
keen
to
exchange
the
first
gifts
,
but
the
laibon
's
family
first
want
to
see
if
he
can
cut
the
mustard
.
The
laibon
communes
with
his
cattle
and
goats
.
His
family
is
doing
all
the
work
,
but
he
is
the
bishop
of
this
church
:
the
cattle
must
receive
his
blessing
.
Fairfax
is
happy
to
watch
.
He
has
no
need
to
analyse
.
He
has
confided
that
he
once
told
Claudia
that
in
real
life
people
do
not
go
around
analysing
everyday
rituals
.
Claudia
had
concluded
that
the
rituals
of
life
have
a
social
significance
:
they
are
what
makes
us
human
.
Incontrovertible
,
but
so
what
?
Arbeit
Macht
Frei
.
Hande
Waschen
,
Nicht
Vergessen
.
These
were
the
social
strictures
of
the
lager
which
,
as
an
anthropologist
,
she
must
have
found
impossible
to
understand
.
They
were
drawn
from
a
deeper
and
darker
place
than
this
whiskery
,
milky
,
dungy
communion
with
the
cattle
.
Victoria
had
accused
me
of
trying
to
thrust
myself
into
the
action
while
pretending
I
want
to
live
a
quiet
life
.
She
suspects
me
of
a
form
of
vanity
in
sidling
up
to
the
existential
questions
.
Here
,
with
my
seal-profile
friend
Fairfax
,
in
the
sight
of
the
Mountain
of
God
,
I
see
that
Victoria
may
have
had
a
point
.
What
business
is
it
of
mine
,
anyway
?
All
I
have
to
do
is
get
a
few
facts
,
give
them
some
colourful
detail
and
write
the
script
.
Nobody
,
and
least
of
all
S.
O.
Letterman
,
expects
me
to
come
back
with
answers
to
unanswerable
questions
.
The
laibon
's
cattle
are
streaming
in
in
their
fullness
.
They
have
all
come
home
from
their
temporary
manyattas
.
Their
big
eyes
are
content
.
Even
their
horns
seem
to
be
full
of
vitality
.
They
low
as
they
push
and
shove
.
One
or
two
try
to
mount
the
animal
in
front
.
The
Masai
stand
among
them
.
They
guide
them
with
the
flick
of
a
thin
stick
or
a
gentle
word
.
The
count
takes
an
hour
.
Fairfax
reckons
there
are
nearly
two
thousand
head
.
He
says
the
word
"
head
"
without
self-consciousness
.
He
's
been
a
farmer
,
a
pilot
,
a
director
of
coffee
plantations
and
an
army
officer
.
And
he
's
had
a
glimpse
of
hell
.
"
Do
you
know
what
I
enjoy
about
this
?
"
he
asks
.
"
Please
tell
me
.
"
"
I
like
to
think
that
it
is
going
on
all
over
Masailand
in
fifty
thousand
kraals
at
this
moment
.
"
But
I
am
plagued
by
the
thought
that
we
have
arrived
at
a
moment
in
history
when
this
is
about
to
be
swept
away
.
Of
course
the
swell
has
been
gathering
force
for
a
century
or
more
,
since
Joseph
Thompson
first
saw
"
the
most
peculiar
band
of
men
to
be
found
in
Africa
"
.
Now
the
wave
is
about
to
break
.
How
many
Masai
will
be
doing
this
in
twenty
years
"
time
?
I
also
wonder
how
many
Fairfaxes
will
be
left
in
twenty
years
.
I
would
hate
to
have
to
tell
him
that
a
new
type
of
gentleman
has
taken
over
the
clubs
and
boardrooms
,
a
man
who
does
not
consider
dishonesty
the
property
of
the
criminal
classes
and
who
,
moreover
,
believes
that
the
notion
of
the
gentleman
is
negotiable
.
I
see
that
what
Durkheim
and
his
pals
feared
has
come
to
pass
:
our
century
has
turned
humanity
into
a
commodity
.
It
is
nearly
dark
.
We
must
go
.
Our
conversation
is
on
hold
.
The
laibon
is
a
descendant
of
the
great
Mbatian
,
the
Bismarck
of
Masailand
.
He
does
n't
need
to
excuse
himself
for
interrupting
his
narrative
.
We
leave
the
boma
which
is
jam-packed
,
seething
with
cattle
.
Fires
are
bright
,
each
one
a
reproach
to
the
night
.
Cows
are
being
milked
.
Some
girls
are
singing
.
The
young
suitor
is
deputed
to
escort
us
to
our
camp
.
I
wonder
if
this
is
a
test
of
bravery
.
Fairfax
speaks
to
him
as
we
walk
across
the
plain
.
I
trail
a
pace
or
two
behind
.
Although
the
sun
has
gone
,
the
moon
has
caught
its
radiance
.
It
is
rising
fast
-
I
swear
I
can
see
its
motion
-
above
the
mountains
.
Even
as
it
rises
,
it
loses
the
counterfeit
warmth
of
the
sun
which
it
has
appropriated
and
becomes
glacial
,
all
its
pockmarks
visible
.
I
envy
Fairfax
his
fluency
in
Maa
.
I
can
only
pick
up
the
linguistic
crumbs
.
Even
professor
Uitsmijter
's
excellent
translations
involve
a
filtration
of
the
nuances
.
When
the
SS
forced
naked
and
freezing
prisoners
to
hop
up
and
down
in
a
swamp
making
frog
noises
,
they
were
acknowledging
the
importance
of
language
in
rendering
us
human
.
(
Perhaps
if
I
knew
the
language
,
I
would
not
have
time
for
these
facile
analogies
.
)
I
want
nothing
more
than
to
walk
along
on
the
darkened
plain
,
the
moon
as
strong
as
winter
sunlight
in
London
,
speaking
Maa
with
this
man
.
He
and
Fairfax
are
laughing
,
but
I
notice
that
he
looks
around
constantly
,
like
a
city
dweller
guiding
country
cousins
across
Oxford
Street
,
and
his
heavy
spear
is
ready
.
If
we
are
eaten
,
he
will
not
be
celebrating
his
engagement
.
He
leaves
us
at
our
camp
under
the
trees
.
His
tall
figure
,
spear
held
on
his
shoulder
,
strides
back
across
the
savannah
until
the
moonlight
gives
out
and
he
is
consumed
by
the
landscape
.
Fairfax
has
a
couple
of
gins
and
tonic
ready
by
the
time
I
have
the
fire
blazing
.
He
has
forgotten
that
I
do
not
drink
,
or
perhaps
he
thinks
I
am
bluffing
.
"
Nice
chap
,
"
he
says
.
"
Little
nervous
.
The
old
laibon

that
what
he
was
telling
you

"
"
Yes

needs
to
get
betrothed
fast

naturally
he
wants
his
little
heifer
to
be
rich
.
He
's
from
a
few
miles
away
,
near
Natron
.
The
old
boy
is
giving
him
hell
.
"
So
under
the
unlikely
moon
they
were
talking

shop

am

that
time

opens
three

deftly
with
a
penknife
and
pours
the
lot

mushroom
soup

wieners

He
ladles
out

I
am
wondering

thinks

That
is
the
question
S.
O.
Letterman
would
be
asking
me
too
if
he
were
here
.
I
try
to
answer
.
I
explain
something
of
my
personal
circumstances
.
We
talk
for
many
hours
.
In
a
tree
an
owlet
whistles
;
it
is
an
irritating
,
nosy-parker
noise
.
My
personal
circumstances
.
Avid
as
I
am
for
details
of
Claudia
's
personal
life
,
I
have
lost
interest
in
the
details
of
my
own
.
Like
pascal
,
I
wish
to
live
quietly
in
my
room
,
which
I
have
interpreted
as
my
head
.
Victoria
has
slipped
from
that
part
of
the
head
where
pressing
thoughts
gather
,
taking
with
her
a
lot
of
the
baggage
that
was
cluttering
up
the
hallways
.
The
sexual
longings
,
the
accusations
,
the
lubricious
details
.
All
gone
,
for
the
moment
anyway
.
As
a
teenager
I
was
worried
by
the
battle
between
the
sexual
thoughts
and
the
more
exalted
impulses
going
on
in
me
.
I
see
now
that
these
were
just
the
first
skirmishes
in
a
never-ending
guerrilla
war
.
These
are
not
the
personal
circumstances
I
recount
to
Fairfax
.
I
do
n't
tell
him
why
I
was
so
keen
to
accept
a
commission
which
involved
six
weeks
in
Africa
,
from
a
fading
and
somewhat
ridiculous
Hollywood
producer
.
Even
as
I
am
recounting
the
edited
version
,
it
occurs
to
me
that
Fairfax
has
probably
been
doing
the
same
thing
.
What
I
tell
him
is
the
background
to
my
commission
to
write
the
script
.
I
tell
him
how
it
all
started
with
an
article
about
French
involvement
in
the
transportations
from
Paris
.
I
tell
him
that
the
idea
of
investigating
the
life
of
a
beautiful
French
anthropologist
,
who
,
in
common
with
seventy
thousand
other
Jews
from
France
,
was
gassed
(
in
a
crowd
,
indistinguishable
to
the
SS
as
the
laibon
's
cattle
are
to
me
)
,
was
my
starting
point
.
My
piece
on
Claudia
Cohn-Casson
had
moved
S.
O.
Letterman
,
the
well-known
Hollywood
producer
,
to
commission
me
to
write
a
script
.
And
here
I
am
.
Here
we
are
,
by
a
redolent
log
fire
,
in
a
world
which
has
slipped
from
sight
.
I
ca
n't
tell
him
how
this
exercise
fits
into
the
human
background
.
I
leave
out
many
things
that
matter
.
We
all
dissemble
on
the
subject
of
our
inner
life
,
because
it
is
in
such
a
fluid
state
.
When
we
talk
about
it
(
now
all
too
common
in
public
)
,
we
do
so
as
though
it
had
set
fast
,
even
for
a
moment
,
in
some
way
.
But
what
are
my
real
purposes
?
I
am
talking
to
a
man
who
has
seen
things
I
can
only
imagine
.
Yet
he
avoids
shows
of
emotion
and
personal
feeling
because
he
believes
they
are
destructive
.
Also
,
if
I
were
to
try
to
explain
to
him
the
nature
of
my
personal
circumstances
,
he
would
be
embarrassed
.
He
has
n't
bought
the
widely
held
idea
that
a
good
airing
is
beneficial
for
the
inner
life
.
There
seems
,
anyway
,
to
be
a
metaphorical
confusion
in
this
idea
:
if
the
inner
life
is
in
need
of
air
,
how
come
it
takes
place
in
the
least
accessible
parts
of
our
being
?
In
my
piece
about
Drancy
,
I
had
written
,
"
There
are
clues
here
to
the
nature
of
humanness
.
"
They
may
be
clues
,
but
the
mystery
is
as
insoluble
as
ever
.
Why
do
I
need
all
this
detail
?
Am
I
expecting
to
be
able
to
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
Claude
Cohn-Casson
?
Am
I
hoping
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
Nazi
mind
?
Of
course
not
.
Perhaps
Victoria
is
right
.
I
pretend
to
believe
in
living
in
my
room
,
but
it
's
true
that
I
am
trying
to
thrust
myself
on
stage
.
The
last
thing
Letterman
wants
from
me
is
an
alternative
,
goy
,
version
of
the
human
dilemma
.
What
he
wants
is
a
confection
.
(
He
is
,
furthermore
,
doing
me
a
favour
:
.
I
have
no
track
record
in
scriptwriting
.
)
He
has
seen
a
certain
facility
in
my
work
for
grading
and
assembling
the
facts
.
He
probably
sees
me
as
having
mechanical
skills
,
like
a
dentist
's
,
which
higher
types
must
occasionally
employ
.
I
am
not
so
green
that
I
expect
to
get
the
sole
credit
on
this
movie
.
I
do
n't
really
believe
it
will
ever
be
made
;
I
am
just
providing
the
raw
material
which
Letterman
and
some
highly
paid
specialist
screenwriter
are
going
to
work
up
into
a
proper
script
.
Letterman
has
already
sent
many
messages
.
His
suggestions
,
his
imperatives
,
have
kept
Mr
Shah
's
fax
humming
.
I
tell
Fairfax
a
great
deal
more
than
I
had
intended
,
but
I
believe
our
confidences
are
drawing
us
together
.
I
certainly
hope
so
.
He
listens
,
and
sometimes
he
inclines
his
head
sympathetically
,
as
if
to
get
a
better
purchase
on
what
I
am
saying
.
I
wonder
,
however
,
if
he
wants
any
more
personal
details
at
his
age
.
There
must
come
a
point
when
you
realize
that
all
these
confidences
are
piling
up
,
useless
,
in
the
store
room
,
like
the
possessions
elderly
people
sometimes
keep
for
no
purpose
.
Eventually
we
retire
.
Retire
is
the
right
term
for
what
he
does
:
it
is
a
ritual
demanding
a
nightcap
,
a
pee
on
the
edge
of
the
firelight
,
another
nightcap
,
the
preparation
of
a
vacuum
flask
of
hot
tea
for
the
bedside
and
a
laborious
change
into
old-fashioned
pyjamas
.
I
have
offered
to
sleep
in
the
back
of
the
Toyota
.
I
hear
his
couchee
going
on
for
some
time
.
The
tent
eventually
fails
into
a
deep
stillness
.
I
do
n't
sleep
immediately
.
I
see
the
editing
together
of
these
elements
repeated
with
new
possibilities
.
Where
do
you
close
off
the
possibilities
when
you
write
a
script
?
For
example
,
does
the
lion
hunt
become
symbolic
,
bigger
than
the
actual
facts
warrant
?
Do
I
try
to
see
it
from
the
laibon
's
point
of
view
?
How
much
should
Fairfax
be
seen
to
know
of
Claudia
's
love
affair
with
the
laibon
's
brother
,
Tepilit
?
And
should
I
ask
Fairfax
's
permission
?
Ail
these
questions
-
and
there
are
many
more
-
also
suggest
to
me
another
bigger
question
,
the
one
that
Victoria
had
noted
,
the
extent
of
my
own
involvement
.
As
I
lie
uneasily
in
the
cab
,
I
wonder
why
it
is
that
I
feel
propelled
to
barge
in
here
.
What
she
is
saying
is
that
there
are
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
out
there
who
can
let
life
go
by
without
trying
to
relate
themselves
to
the
big
issues
.
She
thinks
the
big
issues
are
grist
to
self-appointed
mills
.
It
's
a
devilish
perpetual
motion
contraption
.
Yet
I
see
the
mundane
matter
of
the
script
quite
clearly
.
I
see
the
obvious
physical
limitations
,
one
hundred
minutes
,
no
room
for
interior
monologue
,
unequivocal
scenes
of
love
,
grandeur
and
horror
.
(
Ail
of
which
are
well
represented
in
the
story
as
I
am
learning
it
.
)
What
I
ca
n't
do
,
however
,
is
close
off
the
script
until
I
know
the
facts
.
In
mitigation
I
could
appeal
to
Proust
:
"
Beneath
the
signs
there
lay
something
of
a
different
kind
,
which
I
must
try
to
discover
-
"
Sadly
,
there
is
a
lot
about
proust
's
mission
which
I
will
never
be
able
to
believe
in
.
My
feelings
are
similar
in
this
regard
to
what
Claudia
felt
about
her
father
's
pretensions
.
And
yet
Victoria
has
accused
me
of
exactly
the
same
sin
as
I
am
so
lightly
attributing
elsewhere
(
incidentally
,
to
people
who
are
more
fiction
than
fact
)
.
For
all
I
know
,
Leon
Cohn-Casson
might
have
had
substantial
reasons
for
believing
in
his
invulnerability
.
In
the
way
these
things
happen
,
the
oppressed
are
sometimes
revealed
to
have
a
hold
on
the
oppressors
.
The
survivors
are
the
ones
on
whom
suspicion
falls
.
This
is
commonly
reported
by
the
cursed
survivors
of
Auschwitz
.
I
lie
in
the
metal
box
hoping
to
hear
the
elephant
passing
or
the
lions
roaring
,
but
I
only
hear
a
distant
hyena
against
the
myriad
squeaks
and
screeches
of
the
night
.
These
noises
make
a
tapestry
,
each
one
an
individual
stitch
.
I
owe
it
to
Victoria
to
lend
some
retrospective
weight
to
our
parting
.
Yet
I
can
only
picture
her
in
the
posture
of
Candice
Riberon
in
Le
Metro
lying
on
her
back
,
her
face
caught
in
an
agony
of
uncertain
provenance
.
Sadly
it
's
not
an
erotic
picture
.
It
's
more
like
a
Munch
.
Recalled
sexual
longings
would
at
least
make
me
feel
we
had
not
wasted
our
store
of
human
essence
needlessly
.
I
feel
as
if
I
have
n't
got
that
much
to
spare
.
Also
,
I
wish
to
recall
Victoria
as
an
entire
person
.
But
it
does
n't
work
.
I
see
the
rictus
and
an
entirely
gratuitous
glowing
flush
on
her
throat
.
I
remember
her
claim
-
which
I
found
exciting
-
that
semen
contains
Vitamin
E
and
is
therefore
good
for
the
skin
.
Not
to
be
taken
internally
.
For
external
application
only
.
But
it
does
n't
summon
the
erotic
circumstance
.
Gone
,
gone
,
gone
.
I
climb
out
of
the
Toyota
and
go
to
the
fire
and
push
the
kettle
deep
into
the
ash
which
now
mutes
the
heat
.
Underneath
,
the
embers
are
still
vivid
.
I
wonder
if
more
people
in
the
world
are
still
heating
their
water
in
this
way
than
on
some
sort
of
stove
.
At
first
I
think
that
the
answer
must
be
no
.
But
then
I
reconsider
:
what
about
China
?
I
ca
n't
decide
.
I
place
a
teabag
and
some
powdered
milk
into
the
enamel
cup
and
then
pour
on
the
water
and
stir
with
a
twig
.
There
is
a
lot
of
satisfaction
in
these
simple
actions
.
I
like
the
tea
with
its
powdered
milk
.
Excessively
milky
in
the
way
that
artificial
banana
or
strawberry
can
be
excessive
in
flavour
.
I
drink
deeply
.
Along
with
the
phoney
milkiness
is
the
ever-present
taste
of
wood-ash
.
The
laibon
is
trying
to
tell
us
something
.
Who
knows
what
he
has
been
dreaming
?
His
famous
ancestor
,
Mbatian
,
made
a
prophecy
about
what
would
happen
after
the
arrival
of
the
white
man
.
He
got
his
information
from
God
via
a
dream
.
You
do
n't
need
a
line
to
God
now
to
see
the
way
things
are
going
.
He
has
seen
that
the
Masai
stories
and
dreams
are
not
going
to
be
much
use
in
the
years
to
come
.
I
wish
I
could
tell
him
that
we
are
all
in
the
same
boat
.
I
finish
my
tea
and
climb
back
into
the
Toyota
.
The
laibon
's
fingers
are
like
rolled-up
tobacco
leaves
,
crudely
made
cabbage
cigars
.
They
are
dry
.
You
feel
that
the
skin
would
crackle
if
they
rubbed
together
.
His
hands
are
always
holding
the
cylinder
which
contains
his
stones
.
He
has
read
what
the
care-worn
pebbles
say
,
and
he
does
n't
like
it
.
I
dream
about
the
Masai
.
Specifically
I
dream
about
the
old
man
's
parchment
hands
with
their
cheroot
fingers
,
endlessly
rolling
the
container
in
his
hand
,
this
movement
polishing
and
burnishing
it
,
an
insistent
but
unexplained
movement
of
the
sort
that
happens
in
dreams
.
The
grassland
waves
and
undulates
in
the
morning
light
.
It
looks
like
wheat
,
except
that
right
in
the
middle
of
this
prairie
is
a
group
of
small
hills
rising
unexpectedly
out
of
the
flat
plain
.
The
hills
have
clumps
of
rocks
precariously
balanced
on
them
.
The
rocks
themselves
are
streaked
with
gleaming
mineral
secretions
;
in
the
cracks
between
them
grow
spiky
aloes
with
bright
red
florets
.
Now
a
line
of
Masai
warriors
appears
,
walking
fast
.
They
are
in
elaborate
head-dresses
and
carry
shields
and
spears
.
They
approach
the
first
rocky
hill
and
pause
.
The
colour
of
their
cloaks
is
exactly
the
colour
of
the
aloe
flowers
,
which
stipple
the
rocks
like
blobs
of
oil
paint
.
Some
way
behind
the
warriors
comes
a
small
caravan
of
safari
vehicles
,
two
open-topped
Willys
cars
and
a
truck
.
They
pause
,
too
,
about
a
hundred
yards
from
where
the
Masai
are
fanning
out
around
one
of
the
hills
.
In
the
first
vehicle
are
Waindell
Leavitt
and
Claudia
Cohn-Casson
.
Leavitt
has
binoculars
.
He
looks
ahead
to
see
what
the
Masai
have
found
.
In
the
second
vehicle
are
the
cameraman
,
his
assistant
,
and
the
camera
equipment
.
In
the
truck
are
servants
and
armed
guards
accompanying
the
safari
goods
.
Tepilit
signals
to
the
driver
of
the
first
safari
car
to
stay
where
he
is
.
His
arms
rise
and
his
hands
spread
out
,
pushing
them
back
like
someone
miming
the
action
of
pushing
against
a
wall
.
He
walks
fast
over
to
the
car
and
talks
to
Claudia
in
Maa
.
He
is
lightly
beaded
with
sweat
.
The
lions
are
here
.
"
Claudia
tells
Leavitt
.
"
Okay
,
get
the
equipment
out
.
"
The
Willys
behind
them
is
signalled
to
move
up
.
The
crew
begin
to
rig
the
camera
equipment
on
a
platform
.
This
requires
ropes
and
stays
.
Leavitt
is
stout
and
impatient
in
his
khakis
.
Under
his
bush
hat
he
has
a
thin
moustache
.
"
Let's
get
moving
.
"
Tepilit
is
anxious
.
He
speaks
quietly
to
Claudia
:
"
These
men
from
the
other
side
are
not
brave
.
They
are
afraid
to
kill
the
lion
.
"
"
Be
careful
.
"
"
A
moran
must
be
brave
.
"
Claudia
touches
his
hand
.
Tepilit
goes
to
talk
to
the
warriors
.
There
is
evidently
disagreement
among
them
.
Tepilit
and
his
brother
can
be
seen
arguing
with
the
others
.
In
the
tangle
of
rocks
and
trees
we
get
a
glimpse
of
the
lions
,
now
becoming
agitated
.
The
cameraman
is
taking
light
readings
and
setting
his
lenses
.
The
camera
is
bulky
,
mounted
on
a
wooden
tripod
.
He
wants
to
get
closer
.
They
move
the
car
towards
the
hill
.
The
askaris
have
their.303
rifles
ready
.
Tepilit
comes
running
back
and
speaks
to
Claudia
.
She
translates
for
Leavitt
.
"
He
says
that
the
lions
will
not
stay
any
longer
.
They
will
either
run
or
attack
if
they
are
surrounded
.
"
"
Just
tell
them
to
wait
.
Just
a
few
minutes
.
Come
on
,
load
the
fucking
camera
.
"
The
camera
assistant
drops
a
cumbersome
magazine
.
"
You
dumb-ass
motherfucker
.
"
From
the
hill
,
which
is
now
completely
surrounded
by
Masai
,
we
hear
some
growling
.
The
Masai
have
their
spears
ready
and
their
shields
held
high
.
"
Hold
them
,
for
Chrissakes
.
And
tell
them
we
want
the
action
this
side
of
the
hill
.
"
Claudia
tries
to
explain
to
Tepilit
.
He
gestures
to
her
to
get
back
.
He
says
something
.
"
They
ca
n't
wait
.
The
lions
are
going
to
attack
.
"
"
Are
you
ready
yet
?
"
"
Almost
ready
,
sir
.
"
The
three
vehicles
are
drawn
up
in
a
semi-circle
.
In
front
of
them
is
the
kopje
,
surrounded
by
Masai
.
The
snarling
and
growling
is
very
audible
as
the
lions
move
about
,
looking
for
a
way
out
.
The
camera
assistant
is
having
trouble
getting
the
magazine
on
to
the
camera
.
At
this
moment
a
lion
bursts
out
of
the
long
grass
and
bush
and
leaps
on
a
warrior
.
Tepilit
throws
his
spear
which
strikes
the
lion
just
behind
its
shoulder
.
The
lion
mauls
the
warrior
,
who
is
desperately
trying
to
fend
him
off
with
his
knees
and
shield
.
Tepilit
runs
up
to
the
lion
,
draws
his
long
knife
from
its
sheath
and
sticks
it
into
the
lion
's
throat
.
The
lion
immediately
jumps
on
him
and
forces
him
to
the
ground
.
At
this
moment
another
lion
bursts
out
of
the
bush
and
attacks
a
second
warrior
.
Some
of
the
warriors
run
.
Others
hurl
their
spears
blindly
.
At
least
six
lions
and
lionesses
make
their
escape
,
but
a
third
black-maned
lion
stands
menacingly
ready
to
attack
.
One
of
the
spears
strikes
a
warrior
in
the
chest
.
Claudia
shouts
at
Leavitt
:

Claudia
is

We
see
her
face
,
paralysed
for
a
moment

Tepilit
has
pulled
his
sword
out
of
the
lion
's
neck
and
plunges
it
under
its
throat
again

The
lion
leaves
him
and
staggers
away
before
falling

's
head
is
covered
in
blood
and
his
shoulders
and
arms
are
ripped
open

Claudia
runs
to
the
askaris
and
tries
to
seize
a
gun

The
black-maned

now

in

of

open

the

breaks
out

speaks
to

they
separate
into

trembling

"
The
laibon
has
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
about
this
ugly
incident
.
I
hesitate
to
pronounce
on
the
degree
of
tranquillity
in
his
life
,
but
since
1943
he
has
not
been
further
than
sixty
miles
from
this
spot
.
Compared
with
the
removals
,
job
changes
and
constant
travel
that
have
affected
my
life
,
his
has
been
tranquil
.
Of
course
,
death
and
bereavement
have
come
thicker
and
faster
here
.
That
may
not
be
as
important
,
being
so
frequent
,
in
his
estimation
.
Life
is
cheap
.
But
in
all
these
years
he
has
certainly
been
spared
those
other
,
uninvited
,
distractions
which
sweep
over
our
lives
,
a
snowstorm
of
diversion
and
entertainment
and
half-understood
knowledge
.
What
we
seek
to
see
in
this
blizzard
is
the
spectral
shape
approaching
of
what
was
once
called
-
with
a
straight
face
-
meaning
.
We
know
now
that
the
world
was
not
designed
for
us
,
but
we
have
n't
come
round
to
acting
on
this
knowledge
.
Explanations
are
plentiful
:
absurd
,
irrational
,
unscientific
explanations
,
alongside
absurd
,
rational
,
scientific
ones
.
Although
there
is
no
overall
meaning
,
everything
can
be
explained
on
one
measure
or
another
.
The
laibon
believes
that
he
can
pinpoint
the
beginning
of
his
troubles
to
this
lion
hunt
.
He
is
sitting
at
our
camp
now
,
holding
a
mug
of
our
tea
,
relaxing
on
a
canvas
chair
.
He
sees
that
Leavitt
's
film
introduced
a
new
element
into
the
life
of
his
people
.
For
the
first
time
the
hunting
of
lions
was
treated
as
picturesque
.
It
had
no
other
meaning
.
It
was
as
weightless
as
tribal
dances
performed
for
tourists
.
It
has
taken
him
all
these
years
to
understand
the
implications
.
At
a
turn
of
the
clockwork
motor
of
the
bulky
camera
,
Leavitt
had
proclaimed
that
this
submission
to
the
seasons
,
to
the
rains
,
to
the
predations
of
lions
,
to
the
pasturing
of
cattle
and
all
the
placatory
rituals
that
went
with
it
,
was
unnecessary
.
It
was
flim-flam
,
folklore
,
credulity
.
Its
only
value
was
as
entertainment
in
movie
houses
.
Claudia
's
study
,
while
more
high-minded
than
Leavitt
's
movies
,
had
the
same
general
effect
.
The
laibon
does
not
strictly
say
this
.
His
complaint
is
a
more
general
one
about
the
lack
of
respect
for
custom
and
the
gradual
constriction
of
his
world
that
has
taken
place
in
fifty
years
.
But
the
connection
is
clear
enough
.
The
inner
coherence
of
Masai
life
was
destroyed
by
the
implied
contempt
.
Fairfax
listens
patiently
to
the
laibon
.
As
always
the
laibon
holds
his
snuff
container
.
He
holds
it
the
way
elderly
Greeks
hold
worry
beads
,
a
certain
anxiety
about
the
dwindling
supplies
of
life
remaining
,
kept
at
bay
by
this
endless
fiddling
.
There
are
long
monologues
before
the
laibon
pauses
.
Fairfax
then
summarizes
thoughtfully
what
the
laibon
has
been
saying
.
The
laibon
sees
this
moment
as
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
innocence
.
Leavitt
may
be
the
serpent
,
but
Claudia
is
Eve
.
Gradually
the
consequences
of
that
day
,
the
wising
up
,
have
become
apparent
.
Of
course
,
the
laibon
does
not
phrase
it
as
I
have
.
He
simply
sees
a
connection
between
the
sham
lion
hunt
and
the
all-too-real
execution
of
his
brother
.
Because
of
his
brother
's
hanging
,
he
assumed
the
mantle
of
laibon
.
He
is
wearing
the
mantle
now
,
made
from
the
skins
of
the
hyrax
,
a
flea-ridden
animal
which
looks
like
a
giant
guinea
pig
.
Perhaps
he
has
no
calling
and
has
been
unhappy
in
the
family
business
for
years
.
The
mistake
Claudia
made
was
to
become
part
of
the
total
social
fact
herself
.
Yet
the
laibon
seems
to
be
suggesting
complicity
by
his
own
family
in
what
Fairfax
calls
"
the
balls-up
"
.
They
should
never
have
taken
part
in
something
so
unnatural
.
They
never
would
have
,
but
for
Claudia
's
influence
on
his
brother
.
It
also
occurs
to
me
,
as
I
watch
the
laibon
direct
a
stream
of
sugar
into
his
second
cup
of
tea
,
that
there
may
have
been
something
degrading
about
being
delivered
this
cultural
snub
.
The
idea
that
hunting
lions
was
just
another
native
custom
,
albeit
risky
and
magnificent
,
must
have
been
deeply
wounding
.
The
laibon
wants
it
understood
that
it
has
taken
him
some
time
to
trace
the
trouble
back
to
this
incident
.
"
Ask
him
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
,
if
he
blames
Claudia
.
"
Fairfax
asks
him
and
I
hear
the
choppy
pronunciation
of
her
name
a
number
of
times
.
"
Unfortunately
,
"
says
Fairfax
,
"
he
does
believe
she
was
the
cause
of
the
problem
.
But
as
a
woman
he
does
n't
want
to
give
her
too
much
credit
.
He
does
n't
think
that
women
should
be
allowed
so
much
freedom
of
movement
,
although
he
understands
that
this
is
regrettably
the
custom
,
to
this
day
,
among
white
women
.
"
I
look
carefully
at
Fairfax
's
moist
,
fatigued
eyes
,
which
have
seen
so
much
,
for
signs
of
irony
.
"
Is
that
your
little
joke

possibly

word

In

way
that
was

problem

should

able
to
surpass
men

understanding
.
It
is
not
an

a
woman
,
and
fatal
to
society
,

women
are

important

"
"
Does
he
have
any
idea
what
happened

"
Fairfax
does
not
answer
my
question
.
After
a
pause
,
which
is
,
of
course
,
shredded
by
the
cries
and
protests
of
birds
and
insects
,
he
says
,
"
I
do
n't

"
The
laibon
takes
us
to
the
spot
beneath
the
escarpment
,
looking
down
through
two
rock
walls
onto
the
plain
,
where
Claudia
built
her
little
house
.
The
plains
are
movable
,
subject
to
wind
,
water
and
grazing
.
The
watercourses
wander
,
breaking
and
re-forming
with
the
seasons
.
But
the
escarpments
are
fixed
and
here
,
where
a
stream
tumbles
down
onto
the
plain
,
is
the
site
of
Claudia
's
camp
.
This
is
where
she
and
Fairfax
made
love
.
To
a
Masai
it
is
not
a
good
site
.
It
is
close
to
high
cliffs
where
leopards
live
and
it
is
surrounded
by
trees
,
which
make
cattle-ambush
easy
.
This
is
the
pastoralist
's
view
of
topography
.
For
a
Masai
a
broad
,
grassy
plain
with
barely
a
tree
in
sight
is
preferable
.
But
to
my
eye
it
is
beautiful
.
I
watch
Fairfax
carefully
as
he
talks
to
the
laibon
.
They
are
discussing
the
layout
of
the
camp
.
There
is
nothing
to
be
seen
,
but
the
reconstruction
in
the
imagination
is
tangible
.
Here
stood
the
little
house
looking
down
through
a
frame
of
brown
granite
to
the
plain
below
.
There
were
two
tents
,
thatched
over
against
the
sun
,
and
here
was
the
storeroom
.
Claudia
's
sleeping
tent
stood
just
here
,
with
a
view
all
the
way
to
Ol
Doinyo
Lengai
.
Fairfax
and
the
laibon
stand
on
the
spot
.
They
remind
me
of
a
builder
and
a
client
discussing
the
positioning
of
proposed
works
.
They
agree
on
something
and
smile
.
It
is
camaraderie
on
the
most
ordinary
level
.
A
few
hundred
yards
away
behind
the
site
is
a
cliff
face
,
down
which
a
stream
tumbles
.
I
know
from
Claudia
's
notes
that
this
was
a
seasonal
stream
.
Sometimes
she
had
to
have
water
fetched
from
miles
up
in
the
mountain
.
Like
ail
researchers
and
scientists
in
remote
places
,
she
found
the
arrangements
,
the
logistics
,
more
demanding
than
the
work
itself
.
She
wrote
a
long
letter
to
her
brother
about
these
problems
.
She
worried
about
the
amount
of
supplies
she
needed
.
She
contrasted
this
unfavourably
with
the
simple
needs
of
the
Masai
and
tried
for
a
while
to
live
on
their
diet
of
milk
and
maize
meal
.
It
did
n't
last
:
"
Mais
enfin
,
"
she
wrote
,
"
je
suis
francaise
.
"
She
bought
a
small
shotgun
and
it
was
a
simple
business
shooting
spotted
guineafowl
or
the
umber-coloured
francolin
,
which
she
stewed
slowly
on
the
fire
.
Later
she
tried
to
make
an
oven
out
of
an
iron
safe
,
but
it
did
not
work
.
The
old
men
talk
.
Fairfax
is
no
longer
breaking
off
to
translate
.
Against
the
cliff
they
are
figures
in
a
landscape
painted
in
watercolour
by
some
Victorian
with
grandiose
ideas
about
nature
and
the
sublime
.
It
pulls
at
the
heart
.
Here
they
are
shooting
the
breeze
,
Fairfax
in
his
outmoded
but
perfectly
cut
clothes
,
the
laibon
in
a
dark
blue
shift
and
a
cape
of
fur
,
with
ear
lobes
that
contain
three
or
four
little
bead
earrings
and
a
silver
wire
holding
a
small
copper
bell
.
As
he
gestures
,
his
robe
slips
and
I
can
see
his
penis
,
which
is
inky
black
and
purplish
towards
the
(
circumcized
)
tip
.
It
is
very
long
.
The
century
is
closing
.
Everywhere
I
hear
about
the
malaise
and
uncertainty
this
is
producing
.
But
I
am
looking
at
something
from
the
previous
century
.
Behind
them
the
rock
face
is
bound
together
by
the
rope
roots
of
the
fig
tree
,
and
on
the
hillside
above
them
are
ravines
thick
with
flowering
Cape
chestnuts
;
above
that
level
there
are
hillsides
of
succulents
and
,
even
higher
,
alpine
pastures
and
more
cliffs
.
These
two
old
chaps
both
knew
Claudia
.
It
's
miraculous
.
