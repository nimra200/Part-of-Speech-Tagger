Joe
and
Harry
stood
on
the
platform
side
by
side
.
There
was
now
no
difference
in
their
height
although
Harry
was
twenty-one
and
Joe
sixteen
.
Even
in
physique
they
were
very
much
alike
,
both
being
thick
in
the
shoulders
and
almost
of
the
same
colouring
,
except
that
Joe
's
hair
showed
a
black
sheen
whereas
Harry
's
was
a
dark
brown
,
thick
matt
.
It
was
only
when
you
looked
at
their
faces
that
you
saw
the
difference
in
both
age
and
expression
:
Harry
's
face
was
round
,
his
eyes
merry
,
while
Joe
's
features
inclined
to
length
and
his
grey
eyes
,
which
at
times
seemed
colourless
,
had
in
their
depths
a
touch
of
melancholy
that
had
deepened
with
the
years
.
Joe
started
when
Harry
's
elbow
caught
him
in
the
ribs
as
he
said
,
"
I
wonder
if
my
illustrious

Harry
had
been
about

jovial
retort

was
his
nature
,

he
stopped

,

up
his

Harry
stepped
back
from

now
,

poked
his
head
forward
as
,
under
his
breath
,
he
asked
,

grinned

He
looked
upwards
now
at
the
bunting
stretched
across
the
girders
of
the
platform
,
then
said
,
"

He
began
to
whistle
now
,
accompanying
it
with
a
little
shuffle
of
his
feet
which
brought
a
wide

from
Joe

Harry
's

was
low
,
even
serious
sounding

They
turned

made
their
way
along
the
platform
,
through
the
small
waiting-room
and
so
into
the
road
to

the
horse

For
the
rest
of
the
journey
Joe
listened
to
the
brothers
talking
about
their
futures
,
particularly
that
of
Martin
after
he
came
down
in
June
.
As
for
Harry
,
his
aim
was
engineering
and
he
was
now
in
his
third
year
at
the
College
of
Science
in
Newcastle
.
It
was
as
they
approached
the
gates
that
Joe
pointed
away
to
the
left
and
towards
the
hills
where
a
man
was
walking
and
he
cried
excitedly
,
"

Martin
screwed
up
his
eyes

hills
,

Joe
continued
to
look
over
his
shoulder
to
where
the
figure
in
the
distance
had
become
a
mere
speck
.
When
they
came
in
sight
of
the
house
it
was
to
see
Ellen
Jebeau
standing
on
the
terrace
,
and
when
Martin
drew
the
horse
to
a
standstill
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
she
was
there
to
meet
them
.
Holding
out
her
hand
,
her
smile
wide
,
she
said
,
"
It
's

and
his
answer
was
to
take
her
hand
and
kiss
her
on
the
cheek
and
say
,
"

She
extended
a
hand
towards
Harry
,
and
Martin
said
derisively
,
"

He
'll
never

's
still

playing
with

"
Again
the
two
brothers
were
pushing
at
each
other
and
as
they
all
mounted
the
steps
Ellen
stepped
and
walked
by
the
side
of
her
son
,
something
she
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
whenever
they
were
in
company
,
and
which
Joe
had
been
aware
of
from
the
time
she
had
recovered
after
his
uncle
's
death
.
He
had
n't
known
whether
to
put
it
down
to
the
fact
that
she
imagined
he
was
being
left
outside
the
camaraderie
of
the
brothers
or
that
in
some
strange
way
she
was
laying
claim
on
him
.
Her
action
always
embarrassed
him
,
but
as
it
was
unobtrusive
he
doubted
if
anyone
else
noticed
it
.
In
the

to

said
,

hurried
forward
to
the
dining-room

Martin
exclaimed
in
genuine
appreciation
of
the
table
,
beautifully
decorated
with
flowers

glass
,

silver

set
for
sixteen

He
turned
a
comically
aggressive

He
walked
around
the
table
now
in
an
exaggerated
pose
,

Harry
,
laughing
,
said
,

Martin
was
addressing
Ellen
,

she
,
looking
at
Harry
,
said
,
"

Harry
pulled
a
face
at
his
brother
now
as
Ellen
put
in
quickly
,

She
turned

added
,

Martin
craned

Here
he
turned

from
the
room
,

,
"

They
all
laughed

Even
Ellen
laughed

Harry
now
stood

added
thoughtfully
,

Ellen
paused

just
a

"
Joe
looked
at
his
mother
and
there
came
into
his
mind
a
thought
that
was
n't
new
:
his
mother
did
n't
like
Martin
;
she
liked
Harry
but
not
Martin
;
and
Martin
did
n't
like
her
.
It
was
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
the
sky
was
high
,
the
air
so
clear
that
he
imagined
he
could
see
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
.
He
was
sitting
with
Mick
at
the
top
of
a
hill
and
he
was
wishing
with
a
deep
desire
that
he
could
remain
in
time
,
this
present
time
,
forever
.
Somehow
he
always
had
this
feeling
when
he
was
with
Mick
.
Mick
made
him
feel
rested
:
his
brain
did
n't
churn
and
ask
questions
when
he
was
with
Mick
.
Mostly
he
listened
;
not
that
Mick
talked
a
lot
,
but
when
he
did
everything
he
said
seemed
to
have
meaning
.
Now
,
as
the
thought
came
into
his
mind
he
spoke
it
aloud
,
and
had
he
spoken
like
this
to
anyone
else
it
would
have
been
taken
as
an
insult
,
for
what
he
said
was
,
"
It
's
a
pity
you
have
n't
had
education
,
Mick
.
"
And
Mick
,
looking
straight
ahead
,
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
then
said
,
"
Yes
,
I
've
often
thought
that
,
Joe
,
but
not
so
much
of
late
.
Years
ago
when
I
used
to
see
the
young
masters
going
off
to
their
boarding
schools
-
you
too
,
I
used
to
envy
you
all
.
But
not
any
more
,
because
you
see
this
is
how
I
look
at
it
now
:
those
kind
of
schools
grind
you
into
a
certain
way
of
thinking
and
-
and
somehow
,
unless
you
become
very
careful
,
you
're
stuck
that
way
for
the
rest
of
your
life
.
You
've
been
set
in
a
certain
class
and
no
matter
how
your
opinions
change
and
you
want
to
throw
that
class
off
,
if
ever
a
man
does
,
it
wo
n't
let
him
,
it
's
there
in
his
voice
,
in
his
manner
;
even
if
a
gentleman
was
to
take
to
the
road
he
'd
still
be
a
gentleman
;
I
mean
,
according
to
the
kind
of
education
he
's
received
,
so
to
my
mind
that
has
become
a
kind
of
cage
.
Do
you
follow
me
?
"
They
looked
at
each
other
,
then
returning
their
gaze
to
the
far
distance
there
was
a
silence
between
them
before
Mick
went
on
again
,
"
As
I
see
it
now
,
real
education
is
what
you
get
from
life
:
not
what
life
gives
you
,
but
what
you
give
to
it
.
I
read
a
lot
,
Joe
,
and
it
appears
to
me
that
every
man
,
even
every
thinking
man
has
always
had
a
different
view
of
the
same
subject
;
the
more
I
read
of
men
and
their
lives
and
their
ideas
the
more
I
realise
there
's
no
black
and
white
in
the
world
;
there
's
good
points
to
be
found
even
in
the
blackest
,
and
there
's
some
very
dark
streaks
in
the
so-called
saints
.
As
for
heaven
and
hell
,
well
,
Joe
,
as
I
see
it
we
make
them
both
ourselves

"
"

"
"
Yes

no

n't

to
present
to
us
three
times
on
a
Sunday

"
He
laughed
now
.
"
Eeh

did
put
the
fear
of
God
into
me

You

he
leant
towards
him
now
,
a
wide
grin
spreading
over
his
face

"

used

As
Joe
bowed
his
head
and
laughed
,
Mick
went
on
,
"

every
Sunday
night

years

where
it
was
,
Joe

"
How
he
was
laughing
at
himself

he
could
hardly
get
the
words
out
.
"

the
pig-sties
were

the
stink

Well
"
-
he
choked
now
with
laughter
-
"
I
would
go
in
among
those
pigs
and
they
would
all
start
scratching
a
hole
and
there
I
would
be
standing
on
a
clapboard
looking
down
and
nearly
sick
with
the
smell
.
And
when
it
was
so
deep
I
could
n't
see
the
bottom

Old
Bolton
's

sow

one

borne
so
many
litters

there
was
no
space
atween
her
belly
and
the
ground

Well
,
I
used
to
wait
for
her
,
trembling
like
a
leaf
;
then
she
would
come
behind
me

bump
me

down
I
would
go
,
down

down
,
down

into
hell

wake
up
screaming

our
Charlie
shaking
the
life
out

me

"
Now
both
of
them
were
choking
with
their
laughter
as
Mick
ended
,

so

Joe
was
rocking
himself
now
,
the
tears
running
down
his
face

Then
he
set
Mick
off
into
another
spasm
of
laughter

he
asked
,

looked

had
never
mentioned

years

subject
had
seemed
to
be
taboo
;

he
himself
had
in
a
way
pressed
her
down
into
his
mind

thoughts
of
her
conjured
up
a
feeling
tinged
with
regret

shame

centred
round
a
scene
in
the
bedroom

the
rage
of
his

Joe
slanted
his
gaze
towards
her
.
"

would
n't
try
that
,
Mother

Remember
the
boys
are
at

I
was

go

he
would
immediately

yes

"
As
he
stared
at
her
he
knew
that
he
had
come
to
a
crossroads
,
that
if
he
gave
in
to
her
now
he
'd
have
to
give
into
her
again
and
again
and
again
.
Although
he
had
defied
her
before
,
it
had
only
been
in
words
but
now
the
thought
that
he
had
the
choice
of
putting
those
words
into
action
and
so
set
a
new
pattern
,
and
in
doing
so
break
one
of
the
threads
that
tied
him
to
her
,
caused
his
whole
body
to
tremble
and
his
voice
to
quiver
as
he
said
,
"
Either
you
give
me
permission
freely
to
go
with
Mick
tomorrow
or
I
go
down
now
and
put
it
to
Martin
.
"
The
trembling
turned
to
slight
fear
as
he
saw
her
colour
rise
.
For
a
moment
he
was
swept
back
into
the
past
to
those
days
when
her
temper
would
flare
into
demoniac
rage
.
"
Get
out
of
my
sight
,
boy
.
Get
-
out

of

my

"
He
got
out
of
her
sight
.
He
went
out
of
the
room
,
into
the
corridor
and
into
his
room
and
there
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
door
,
his
mouth
wide
,
gasping
at
the
air
,
still
in
fright
,
yet
knowing
that
in
some
way
he
had
emerged
as
if
out
of
a
deep
canyon
.
Joe
sat
on
the
wooden
kitchen
chair
and
watched
Mrs
Alice
Carver
flitting
back
and
forth
from
the
stove
to
the
table
,
talking
all
the
while
.
She
had
what
was
termed
a
comfortable
figure
,
but
her
face
was
thin
,
her
nose
sharp
and
her
voice
seemed
to
take
its
pattern
from
her
features
,
just
as
Mick
had
described
her
on
the
way
here
;
although
his
Aunt
Alice
was
sharp
of
nose
and
of
tongue
,
she
was
broad
in
the
shoulders
and
warm
in
heart
,
he
had
said
.
Flinging
a
cloth
over
a
side
table
,
she
now
turned
towards
Mick
and
said
,
"

short

She
was
now
piling
crockery
on
to
the
table
.
"

a

minutes
after

n't
stopped
to
gaze
in
the
shops

at

"
She
had
now
turned
abruptly
and
was
addressing
Joe
,
and
he
,
taken
by
surprise
,
stammered
,
"
Yes
-

No

you

She
now
pushed
out
her
chest
,
drew
in
her
chin
,
looked
at
Mick
while
thumbing
towards
Joe
and
said
,
"

Did
you
hear
that
?
He
expects
his
dinner

"
Mick
looked
at
Joe
,
whose
face
had
turned
scarlet
,
and
nodded
solemnly
as
he
said
,
"
Aye

does
,
Aunt
Alice
.
It
's
a
bloomin'
cheek

"
Then
they
were
both
laughing
,
and
the
little
woman
,
coming
up
and
slapping
Joe
between
the
shoulders
with
such
force
that
he
coughed
,
said
,
"

"
Joe
managed
to
force
a
smile
.
Then
looking
back
at
Mick
who
was
grinning
at
him
,
he
bit
on
his
lip
and
moved
his
head
slightly
as
if
to
say
,
"
How
am
I
to
take
her
?
"
Mick
now
turned
to
his
aunt
and
asked
,
"

Carrie

her
test
?
"
"
Of

'll

you
something

she
paused
,
went
to
the
oven
,
took
out
a
tin
holding
roast
potatoes
,
flicked
them
over
expertly
and
put
the
tin
back
in
the
oven
before
she
continued
,
"
She

that
school

she
's
a
way
ahead

know
what

"
She
put
her
hands
on
the
table
and
leant
towards
Mick
.
"

's
going

typewriter

old
thing

a
noise

a
candyman
's
trumpet
.

she
does
n't
know
,
so
do
n't
let
on

she
's

Joe
had
gauged
that
the
"
he
"
she
referred
to
was
the
uncle
and
the
reference
to
Pitman
's
shorthand
brought
his
eyes
to
Mick
and
his
face
ready
to
go
into
a
grin
;
but
something
in
Mick
's
expression
checked
it
and
he
listened
to
him
saying
,
"
She
's
a
bright
lass
,
is
Carrie
.
"
"
Now
you
've
said
it
,
Mick
,
you
've
said
it
.
Yes
,
our
Carrie
's
a
bright
lass
.
And
she
's
going
places
.
"
Joe
noticed
that
the
little
woman
referred
to
Carrie
as
if
she
belonged
to
them
:
it
was
Our
Carrie
.
In
his
mind
's
eye
there
was
dawning
a
picture
of
this
Carrie
.
He
could
see
the
smart
business
girl
:
she
'd
likely
be
wearing
three-inch
high
heels
and
her
hair
would
be
permed
;
and
not
only
would
she
look
smart
,
she
'd
talk
smart
.
For
a
moment
he
wished
he
had
n't
come
:
he
did
n't
want
to
see
this
new
Carrie
.
On
the
way
here
this
morning
,
the
picture
of
the
Carrie
he
had
once
known
and
played
with
-
and
loved
,
had
been
plain
in
his
mind
;
and
the
nearer
he
had
come
to
the
house
where
she
now
lived
,
he
imagined
the
Carrie
he
expected
to
see
would
be
merely
an
older
replica
of
the
one
who
had
run
out
of
his
life
the
day
his
mother
had
hit
him
and
knocked
him
out
.
That
memory
too
had
been
brought
sharply
into
focus
on
this
journey
.
It
was
as
if
his
mind
was
digging
down
through
the
years
and
bringing
up
pictures
of
past
events
-
Stan
Carver
was
a
thick-set
,
medium-sized
man
,
and
strangely
,
Joe
thought
,
he
resembled
his
wife
,
at
least
in
features
:
they
had
the
same
sharp-edged
face
.
What
was
obvious
,
though
,
straightaway
was
that
Mr
Carver
did
n't
talk
much
and
his
greeting
of
Mick
was
as
to
one
of
the
family
,
indicated
with
a
nod
and
a
"
Hello
,
there
!
"
When
Mick
introduced
him
,
Mr
Carver
shook
his
hand
in
the
conventional
way
,
saying
,
"
I
'm
pleased
to
see
you
,
lad
.
You
're
welcome
,
"
then
went
to
the
sink
in
the
far
corner
of
the
kitchen
to
wash
his
hands
,
came
back
to
the
fireside
to
sit
down
in
a
chair
to
the
right
of
the
oven
,
and
watched
his
wife
putting
out
the
meal
.
It
was
as
she
put
the
last
plate
on
the
table
that
the
door
opened
and
Carrie
Smith
entered
the
kitchen
.
Automatically
Joe
rose
to
his
feet
,
although
Mick
remained
seated
.
The
girl
who
was
now
confronting
Joe
was
someone
strange
and
of
whom
he
held
no
memory
in
any
corner
of
his
mind
.
She
was
n't
smartly
dressed
as
he
had
imagined
:
a
slack
grey
coat
reached
halfway
down
her
calves
,
her
hat
was
in
plain
brown
felt
and
from
under
it
her
hair
hung
loose
.
It
was
rather
unusual
,
he
thought
,
to
see
a
girl
with
long
hair
hanging
loose
.
Her
hair
was
dark
brown
,
as
were
her
eyes
;
her
face
was
round
,
her
cheeks
naturally
red
.
She
was
wearing
no
make-up
;
she
could
have
been
a
girl
fresh
from
the
country
.
That
was
until
she
spoke
.
When
her
voice
came
to
his
ears
it
denied
the
ordinariness
of
her
clothes
and
the
simplicity
suggested
by
her
powderless
face
and
loose
lying
hair
,
for
her
tone
was
crisp
,
each
word
clear
.
Unlike
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
who
spoke
with
the
Northern
inflection
,
drawing
one
word
into
another
,
she
pronounced
the
last
syllable
of
each
word
.
This
,
however
,
he
did
n't
realise
until
later
when
he
let
himself
think
about
the
meeting
and
how
,
after
the
first
keen
glance
,
she
looked
past
him
as
if
he
were
n't
there
,
to
greet
Mick
with
"
Hello
.
You
did
n't
say
you
were
coming
.
Why
are
n't
you

?
"
"
I
'm
on
holiday
.
The
boss
knew
I
was
worked
to
death
,
and
not
wanting
to
lose
me
said
,
"
Mick
,
you
take
a
few
days
rest
.
if
anybody
's
earned
them
,
you
have
.
"
"
Oh
yes
?
"
She
inclined
her
head
towards
her
brother
.
"
I
can
quite
understand
that
he
would
say
that
.
"
She
was
taking
off
her
hat
and
coat
as
she
spoke
;
then
going
over
to
her
aunt
,
she
bent
down
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
,
and
followed
this
with
the
same
salutation
for
her
uncle
;
and
in
response
he
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
.
"
Have
n't
you
noticed
we
've
got
a
visitor
?
"
She
had
been
looking
at
Mick
,
but
turned
slowly
and
looked
at
Joe
,
and
smiling
slightly
said
,
"
Yes
;
yes
,
of
course
.
"
"
Well
,
do
n't
you
know
who
he
is
?
"
When
she
looked
back
at
Mick
she
allowed
her
gaze
to
rest
on
him
for
some
seconds
before
she
answered
,
"
Of
course
I
know
who
it
is
.
He
has
n't
changed
much
.
"
Joe
felt
a
heat
seeping
up
through
his
body
,
finally
coming
to
rest
in
his
face
,
which
he
knew
now
had
turned
scarlet
.
It
was
more
than
five
years
since
she
had
seen
him
and
she
was
saying
he
had
n't
changed
.
He
imagined
for
a
moment
that
he
was
still
in
short
pants
,
until
she
turned
to
him
and
added
,
"
What
I
mean
is
,
I
would
have
still
recognised
you
,
"
and
as
if
to
soften
her
first
statement
she
added
further
,
"
Of
course
,
you
've
grown
much
taller
.
You
would
have
,
would
n't
you
?
"
As
he
stared
at
her
he
actually
did
feel
as
if
he
were
in
short
pants
,
and
he
could
n't
find
words
to
answer
her
.
The
situation
was
saved
for
him
by
Mrs
Carver
's
crying
,
"
Well
,
there
it
is
!
It
's
on
the
table
.
Take
your
seats
;
there
's
nothing
worse
than
a
cold
dinner
.
"
As
he
moved
towards
the
table
Joe
noticed
that
,
although
they
had
been
bidden
to
take
their
seats
,
neither
Mrs
Carver
,
nor
Mick
,
nor
Carrie
did
until
Mr
Carver
was
seated
;
then
,
each
pulling
a
chair
out
from
under
the
table
,
they
sat
down
;
and
having
done
so
,
Mick
pointed
to
a
carved
chair
with
a
leather
seat
and
said
to
him
,
"
Come
,
sit
down
.
You
're
honoured
;
that
's
from
the
parlour
;
I
hope
your
pants
are
clean
.
"
Joe
sat
down
and
,
shyly
taking
up
his
knife
and
fork
,
he
began
to
eat
;
but
with
some
difficulty
,
for
there
was
no
conversation
.
And
he
was
embarrassed
further
when
he
realised
he
was
the
last
to
finish
.
They
waited
for
him
,
and
when
his
plate
was
clean
,
Mrs
Carver
,
leaning
towards
him
,
said
,
"
Spotted
Dick
or
rice
?
"
He
blinked
and
opened
his
mouth
once
before
he
managed
,
"
Spotted
Dick
,
please
.
"
Spotted
Dick
.
That
was
what
Mary
called
currant
pudding
,
and
his
mother
referred
to
as
boiled
fruit
suet
.
He
enjoyed
his
Spotted
Dick
;
but
this
,
too
,
was
eaten
in
silence
.
The
meal
finished
,
Stan
Carver
,
placing
his
hands
on
each
side
of
his
plate
,
slowly
raised
himself
up
from
the
table
and
,
standing
still
for
a
moment
,
said
,
"
Thank
God
for
a
good
dinner
.
"
And
without
another
word
he
left
the
table
,
went
out
of
the
kitchen
,
presumably
through
the
scullery
,
and
into
the
backyard
;
and
when
the
sound
of
the
door
shutting
came
to
them
,
Mick
turned
with
a
laugh
towards
Joe
,
saying
,
"
I
bet
you
're
wondering
where
the
first
part
of
grace
before
meals
went
.
"
Managing
a
smile
,
Joe
said
,
"
Yes
;
perhaps
I
am
.
"
"
Well
,
I
might
tell
you
that
Uncle
follows
a
pattern
that
was
forced
upon
him
.
You
see
,
he
came
from
a
family
of
ten
lads
and
four
lasses
and
food
was
the
main
object
in
their
lives
;
and
if
you
were
n't
careful
and
hung
on
to
your
plate
one
or
the
other
swiped
it
.
"
He
nodded
.
"
It
's
a
fact
.
They
did
it
laughingly
,
but
they
did
it
;
so
that
cut
out
forever
the
grace
that
says
,
what
we
are
about
to
receive
,
so
he
only
gives
thanks
when
he
's
got
it
down
.
"
As
they
all
laughed
,
Joe
glanced
towards
the
little
woman
,
and
she
,
nodding
back
to
him
,
said
,
"
'T
IS
true
.
"
Then
,
looking
towards
Carrie
,
she
said
,
"
Mash
the
tea
,
girl
.
Time
's
going
on
;
you
'll
have
to
be
on
your
way
again
.
"
And
with
this
she
went
into
the
scullery
,
Mick
following
her
.
Left
alone
with
Carrie
,
Joe
sat
watching
her
pour
the
boiling
water
into
the
earthenware
teapot
,
and
after
bringing
it
to
the
table
and
setting
it
on
a
stand
,
she
smiled
at
him
and
said
softly
,
"
How
are
you
?
"
"
Very
well
,
thank
you
.
And
you
?
"
His
voice
was
as
low
as
hers
had
been
.
"
Oh
,
I
'm
fine
,
fine
.
"
It
was
as
if
they
had
just
met
.
"
I
was
n't
meaning
to
be
rude
when
I
said
you
had
n't
changed

"
"
Oh
,
I
know
,
I
know

"
he
said
and
smiled
widely
.
"
It
was
just
that
I
was
a
bit
surprised
at
seeing
you
.
When
I
've
been
back
home

've
always
been
at
school

"
Yes
;
yes

would
be

they
arranged
it
like
that
.

He
bit
on
his
lip
;
he
had
n't
meant
to
say
that
.
What
had
possessed
him
?
"
Yes
,
I
suppose
they
did
.
Anyway

I
do
n't
go
very
often

"

"

"
She
shook
her
head
;
then
jerked
it
backwards
,
indicating
the
scullery
,
as
she
added
in
a
much
lower
tone
,
"
They
're
not
really

aunt

"
"
Oh
yes
.
Well
!
what
do
you
think
,
after
that
cottage

"
The
statement
was
somehow
a
reflection
on
his
uncle
and
now
on
Martin
as
his
successor
-
And
yet
he
himself
had
often
thought
the
cottages
should
have
been
extended
or
pulled
down
and
rebuilt
.
There
was
still
no
indoor
sanitation
or
running
water
.
"
You
prefer
living
in
the
town

he
said
.
"
Every
time

she
bobbed
her
head
at
him
"

anybody

She
now
poked
her
face
towards
him
,
for
her
words
had
not
been
a
statement
but
a
direct
question
,
one
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
,
and
when
he
did
n't
answer
she
went
on
,
"
It
was
all
right
for
you
.
Not
that
I
'm
blaming
you

Do
n't
you

that
.

in
your
position

decent
surroundings

Magnificent

be
a
better
description

really
magnificent

she
again
contradicted
herself
,

know
what
I
mean

"

It
was
he
who
was
now
leaning
towards
her
,
and
his
voice
and
face
serious
as
he
went
on
,
"
A

house

room

all
the
food

only
there

very
small
part

She
bowed
her
head
as
she
apologised
,
"

They
started
now
as
the
sound
of
breaking
china
came
to
them
,
followed
by
Mrs
Carver
's
voice
on
a
note
so
high-pitched
it
was
almost
a
scream
,
as
she
cried
,
"

Mick
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
his
hands
going
through
his
hair
,
his
head
thrust
forward
and
his
mouth
in
an
elongated
0
,
to
be
greeted
by
Carrie
saying
,
"
Eeh

was
it

She
now
grinned
at
him
as
she
pushed
him
,
only
to
cry
at
him
under
her
breath
as
he
lifted
the
teapot
,
"

As
Carrie
was
pouring
out
the
tea
,
Mr
Carver
came
back
into
the
room
,
followed
by
his
wife
,
and
he
said
to
Mick
,
"
Stay

scullery

Mr

gulped
through
his

As
Joe
watched
her
put
on
her
coat
and
hat
he
experienced
a
keen
sense
of
disappointment
,
for
he
was
realising
it
had
been
in
his
mind
to
escort
her
to
work
.
Whether
Mick
would
have
proposed
this
he
did
not
know
;
he
only
knew
that
the
desire
had
been
there
;
but
it
seemed
to
be
the
pattern
that
she
and
her
uncle
left
together
at
dinnertime
.
She
was
standing
in
front
of
him
and
when
,
conventionally
,
she
held
out
her
hand
towards
him
,
saying
,
"
Goodbye
,
then
,
"
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
;
then
his
arm
jerked
forward
and
he
was
holding
her
hand
.
He
felt
the
warmth
of
it
flowing
up
his
arm
like
an
injection
;
it
was
as
if
everything
in
her
was
being
transmitted
through
their
palms
.
But
as
quickly
as
his
arm
had
gone
out
,
it
returned
to
his
side
,
jerked
back
there
as
if
by
a
spring
;
and
he
noticed
that
his
action
had
n't
gone
unnoticed
by
Mick
.
He
now
watched
Mick
follow
Carrie
to
the
door
way
that
led
into
the
scullery
,
and
he
found
himself
also
stepping
in
that
direction
,
until
he
could
take
in
the
whole
of
the
scullery
and
the
open
backyard
door
through
which
Mr
Carver
was
now
passing
,
saying
as
he
did
so
,
"
Ta-rah

then

"
It
was
a
salutation
to
cover
all
those
present

Then
he
saw
Carrie
turn
and
look
at
Mick
and
Mick
take
her
by
the
shoulders
and
look
down
into
her
face
.
He
heard
him
speak
some
words
,
but
he
could
n't
make
out
what
they
were
;
he
then
saw
him
bend
and
kiss
her
,
not
on
the
cheek
but
on
the
lips
.
Then
Mrs
Carver
's
voice
from
behind
him
cried
,

he
sprang
aside
to
let
her
enter
the
scullery

a
tray
of
dirty
cups
and
saucers

Ellen

back
was
bent
,
her
head
thrust
out

At
this
moment
she
looked
to
Joe
like
a
witch
and
her
voice
and
words
sounded
as
ominous
as
any
that
could
have
been
uttered

an
authentic

she
hissed
at

got

all
I
've
got
left
to
build
my
life
on

my
life
has
been
one
long
frustration
,
and
to
stand
aside
and
see
you
throw
yourself
away
on
scum
like

"
She
had
advanced
a
step
further
towards
him
until
now
they
were
standing
almost
breast
to
breast
.
"
I
am
your
mother

I
have
worked
for
you
in
all
ways
practically
from
the
moment
you
were
born

I
'd
die
rather
than
see
you
throw
yourself
away
on
the
likes
of
her

she
is
scum
,

I
repeat
it
,
scum
.
She
hails

at
her
mother

the
rest
of
them

"
He
was
unable
to
speak
but
he
glared
back
into
her
infuriated
countenance
,
and
when
she
said
,
"
And
do
n't
bring
Mary
and
Mick
up
as
examples
of
paragons
,
for
Mary
is
really
witless
;
she
's
a
good
servant
and
nothing
more
.
As
for
Mick
aiming
to
rise
above
himself
,
he
'll
never
do
it
.
And
he
's
crafty
;
you
can
see
it
in
his
face
.
And
I
know
he
's
behind
your
meetings
with
that
girl
.
Doubtless
he
wants
to
see
her
established
in
this
house
.
"
It
was
now
he
who
stepped
back
from
her
,
almost
pushing
her
aside
with
his
forearm
as
he
said
,
"
Do
n't
be
ridiculous
.
Neither
you

I
have
any
claim
on
this
house

you
know
it
.
When
I
marry
I
ca
n't

.
As
for
you
,
Mother
,
when
Martin
marries
it
'll
be
Uncle
's
case
all
over
again

you
'll
either
have
to
step
down

go

"
His
lips
were
still
purse
on
the
last
words
when
they
suddenly
sprang
wide
as
he
saw
her
almost
stagger
back
from
him
,
her
hand
to
her
throat
,
the
colour
draining
from
her
face
.
This
was
the
sort
of
reaction
that
usually
followed
a
burst
of
temper
bordering
on
rage
.
As
she
groped
towards
a
chair
he
made
no
move
towards
her
but
watched
her
sit
down
,
then
bow
her
head
for
a
moment
before
slowly
raising
her
eyes
to
his
again
when
,
in
a
voice
that
had
lost
none
of
its
bitterness
,
she
said
"
Leave
me
;
but
I
'm
warning
you

'll
see
you
dead
first

He
was
still
visibly
shaken
when
he
entered
his
own
room
where
,
going
to
the
window
,
he
placed
both
hands
on
the
sill
and
bowed
his
head
.
She
was
mad

She
was
mad

was
;
she
was
mad

His
head
came
up
sharply
.
"

"
That
was
Martin

He
went
hastily
towards
the
door
;
he
did
n't
want
Martin
to
come
into
the
room
because
then
he
might
break
down
and
say
things
about
his
mother
that
were
best
left
unsaid
.
They
met
on
the
stairhead
and
Martin
cried
,
"

Martin
put
his
arm
around
Joe
's
shoulders
and
together
they
went
down
the
stairs
.
"

He
followed
Martin
to
the

stood
in
a

of
the
hall

Martin
's
voice
was
low
,
with
a
note
of
sadness
in
it
now
,
as
he
said
,

They
clinked
their
glasses

walking
towards
the
long
window

"
Of
a
sudden
Joe
was
thankful
that
a
war
had
been
declared
:
Martin
would
join
up
and
,
because
of
his
principles
,
he
would
n't
then
marry
Miss
Crosbie
.
That
would
be
one
less
thing
for
him
to
worry
about
with
regards
to
his
mother
,
for
she
would
still
be
mistress
of
the
house
,
at
least
until
the
war
was
over
,
which
might
go
on
for
a
year
,
perhaps
two
.
For
most
people
in
England
the
war
had
n't
yet
begun
.
The
general
opinion
was
that
it
had
fizzled
out
;
like
a
spent
squib
,
it
had
n't
even
given
one
burst
.
It
was
a
fortnight
now
since
it
had
started
with
such
a
hullabaloo
,
but
there
had
been
no
raids
,
and
no
bombs
had
been
dropped
;
the
sirens
went
and
people
made
for
the
shelters
,
but
more
and
more
half-heartedly
,
as
days
passed
and
nothing
exciting
happened
.
The
only
thing
that
seemed
to
be
stirring
most
people
was
their
scorn
of
Chamberlain
.
Of
course
there
was
the
black-out
,
and
that
was
enforced
,
and
everybody
had
to
carry
gas
masks
.
There
were
no
street
lights
any
more
and
cars
could
n't
use
their
headlights
,
and
it
was
being
said
that
more
people
were
being
killed
this
way
than
if
a
real
war
had
come
upon
them
.
Joe
should
have
gone
back
to
school
the
previous
week
but
it
was
being
used
as
an
evacuation
centre
.
The
upper
school
were
remaining
but
it
would
be
at
least
another
week
before
he
'd
have
to
return
.
The
war
had
n't
seemed
to
touch
the
house
,
that
is
until
the
morning
a
lady
arrived
in
a
car
from
Hexham
.
She
asked
Ellen
how
many
children
she
was
prepared
to
take
.
She
got
no
further
than
the
hall
and
Ellen
's
answer
could
have
been
heard
in
every
corner
of
the
house
:
"
None
!
"
"
None
?
"
said
the
lady
.
"
None
,
"
repeated
Ellen
.
"
You
might
be
forced
to
,
"
said
the
lady
quietly
.
"
Then
you
'll
have
to
go
over
the
heads
of
the
military
and
Sir
Martin
,
for
he
's
thinking
of
using
this
house
as
a
convalescent
base
for
officers
.
"
"
Oh
,
"
said
the
lady
,
slightly
mollified
.
"
Oh
,
I
'm
sorry
.
"
"
Good
morning
.
"
The
lady
went
out
and
drove
away
and
Joe
,
who
had
witnessed
the
meeting
,
went
into
the
kitchen
where
Mary
was
saying
to
Helen
,
"
Eeh
!
the
lies
rolled
off
her
like
butter
off
a
hot
griddle
.
"
"
There
's
no
truth
in
it
at
all
then
,
you
do
n't
think

"
said
Helen
.
"
Not
a
word
,
"
said
Mary
.
Then
turning
to
Joe
she
asked
,
"
You
,
Master
Joe
,
you
've
heard
nothing
about
officers
coming
here
,
have
you
?
"
"
No
,
Mary
,
"
he
said
.
"
No
"
-
Mary
turned
to
her
sister
-
"
no
,
it
's
as
I
said
,
the
lies
.
"
Then
realising
to
whom
she
was
referring
she
stopped
and
,
embarrassed
now
,
she
muttered
,
"
Well
,
it
was
a
fib
in
a
good
cause
;
we
do
n't
want
bairns
scampering
around
this
place
,
do
we
?
"
"
No
,
I
suppose
not

"
he
answered
.
"
You
suppose
not
?
Aye
,
Master
Joe
,
you
'd
suppose
not
if
you
saw
some
of
them
from
the
towns
.
Lousy
they
are
,
their
hair
nearly
walks
by
itself

tell
you
I
know
.

ca
n't

getting
a
nit
or
a
dickie

school

some
of
those
town
bairns
are
lousy

do
n't
want
any
like
that
here

Your
mother
was
quite
right
.
Do
you
want
a
scone
?
"
"
Yes
,
please
.
"
She
split
open
a
newly
baked
scone
and
thickened
it
with
butter
and
as
she
handed
it
to
him
she
added
,
"
There
's
rationing
comin'
,
that
's
what
they
say

curtailing
the
food

pigs
are
more
bloomin'
nuisance

the
horses

What
do
you
say
,
Master
Joe
?
"
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
suppose
so
.
"
He
smiled
at
her
,
the
while
thinking
,
why
was
it
he
always
sounded
inane
when
talking
to
any
of
the
Smiths
,
with
the
exception
of
Mick
?
He
did
n't
even
show
up
brightly
with
Carrie
.
"
You
suppose
so
?
Well
,
I
should
think
so
;
you
'd
grumble
if
you
did
n't
get
your
butter
,
would
n't
you
?
"
He
smiled
broadly
and
he
turned
from
her
,
munching
at
the
buttered
scone
,
and
as
he
walked
out
of
the
back
door
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
car
coming
on
to
the
gravel
in
front
of
the
house
.
By
the
time
he
reached
the
end
of
the
yard
Martin
was
already
out
of
the
car
and
was
running
up
the
steps
to
the
house
.
Joe
paused
for
a
moment
.
He
knew
that
Martin
had
seen
him
and
yet
he
had
taken
no
notice
of
him
.
Was
something
wrong
?
Swallowing
the
last
of
the
scone
he
ran
over
the
drive
and
into
the
house
to
see
Martin
disappearing
into
the
study
.
He
did
not
go
towards
the
study
door
because
his
mother
,
coming
down
the
stairs
,
called

She
made
for
the
study
door
and
he
wanted
to
say
,

He
was
a
little
way
behind
her

she
knocked
on
the

When
there
was
no

slowly

the
handle

pushed
the
door
open

Looking
to
the
side

her

he
could
see
Martin
standing
with
his
arms
folded
and
resting
on
the
mantelshelf

Joe
followed
his

into
the

they
stood
looking
at
Martin
,

had
his
back
to
the
empty
grate
now

was
staring
at
them
as
if
he
was
n't
seeing
them

Then
his
words
came
in
a
mutter
so
unlike
his
usual
jaunty
tones
as
he
announced
,
"

flung

Of
a
sudden

sat
down
in

Joe
,
looking
at
him
,
had
a
strange
thought

for
his
mind
was
saying
that
if
men
could
cry
,
Martin
would
be
crying
now
.
He
was
about
to
take
a
step
towards
him
when
his
mother
said
,
"

"
"

As
he
passed
her
he
stopped
and
said
,

give
you
any
idea

"
No

He
sounded
quite
cheery

said

he
's
going

He
was
nodding
at
her

obviously
relieved
now
,

turning
to
Joe
,
he
thrust
out
his
hand

rumpled
his
hair
as
he
said
,

jerked
his
chin

stretch
himself
inches
upwards

thrust
out
his
chin

marched
from

Joe
turned
and
looked
at
his
mother

had
her
eyes
on
the
figure
striding
across
the
hall
towards
the
telephone
table
,
and
the
look
on
her
face
caused
him
to
close
his
own
eyes
for
a
moment
,
for
he
knew
how
she
had
taken
what
Martin
had
said
:
although
it
had
been
voiced
lightly
it
was
meant
to
have
serious
intent
,
and
in
her
own
mind
his
marrying
would
mean
once
again
that
she
would
have
notice
to
quit
.
"
Well

it
's
up

you

you
stay

one
thing
I
wo
n't
tolerate

your
continued
manner

pulled
in
his
chin

he
looked
at

continuing
,

Ellen
Jebeau
brought
her
lips
tightly
together

drew
them
inwards

teeth

deep
bitterness

had
been
seated
each
side

the
blazing
fire
in
the
drawing-room
,
but
now
Martin
had
sprung
to
his
feet

his
voice
raised
as
he
repeated
,
"

come
on

come
on

Ellen

Father
took
you
and
the
youngster
in
twelve

no
,
thirteen
years
ago
;
he
made
it
possible
for
you
not
only
to
live
comfortably

well

to
educate
the
laddie

took
on

he
left
off

what
have
you
done
for
me
?
Now
,
now
!
let's
put
matters
straight
.
Besides
being
allowed
to
play
mistress
of
this
house
for
years
,
you
've
been
given
a
good
allowance
.
And
,
if
I
remember
rightly
,
Father
was
not
only
going
to
continue
that
allowance
but
had
bought
a
house
for
you
,
had
n't
he
?
Well
,
I
ca
n't
promise
that
if
you
leave
I
'll
be
as
generous
as
he
was
;
I
'll
continue
your
allowance
certainly
,
but
as
for
a
house
,
no
;
for
as
you
are
well
aware
,
because
you
know
the
books
as
well
as
I
do
,
it
takes
us
all
our
time
,
even
with
my
salary
,
to
continue
living
here
as
we
have
done
of
yore
.
So
do
n't
speak
to
me
of
ingratitude
.
And
just
in
case
I
may
say
things
I
'll
be
sorry
for
,
I
'd
better
not
go
on
,
except
for
one
last
word
.
My
wedding
is
set
for
April
;
whether
I
'm
called
up
or
not
,
it
's
going
through
.
It
could
have
been
different
if
I
had
been
accepted
for
the
Forces
,
but
this
way
I
mean
to
make
Marion
my
wife
and
I
hope
-
well
-
well
"
-
he
jerked
his
head
upwards

"
I
may
as
well
say
it

a
son

second
best

a
daughter

carry
on

seem

have
great
respect

for
this
house
too

the
men
who
have
gone
before
me
who
made
it

Ellen

see

plans

moved
a
step

two
from

Then
,
turning

looking
into

tight

white
countenance

added

quietly

second
thoughts

up
them

doorway

He
watched

walk
away

speaking

enter

hall
again

had
expected

up

pan

fire

now

smiled
softly
at
him
as
he
said
,
"
I
would
,
laddie
,
but
you
'd
better
not
;
I
think
your
mother
needs
you
tonight
.
She
's
had
a
bit
of
a
blow
.
I
'm
sorry
I
had
to
deliver
it
,
but
there
it
is
.
"
The
message
in
the
words
sounded
ominous
to
Joe
's
ears
,
and
he
straightened
up
and
said
,
"
Tell
Harry
I
'll
be
thinking
of
him
and
I
hope
he
'll
be
home
soon
.
"
"
I
'll
do
that
.
"
The
car
gave
a
roar
,
then
slowly
moved
out
of
the
garage
;
the
dim
side-lights
showed
a
pale
flicker
on
the
back
of
the
house
,
then
swung
around
for
an
instant
on
to
the
gardens
.
The
next
second
the
light
was
gone
and
Martin
with
it
,
and
Joe
stood
in
the
yard
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
without
a
coat
and
that
the
cold
was
seeping
through
his
pullover
,
for
his
outer
self
was
no
colder
than
the
feeling
within
him
that
had
been
evoked
by
Martin
's
last
words
concerning
his
mother
.
He
drew
in
a
deep
icy
breath
,
then
straightened
his
shoulders
,
a
habit
he
was
forcing
upon
himself
a
lot
of
late
,
then
made
his
way
towards
the
kitchen
,
to
be
greeted
by
Mary
with
,
"
He
's
gone
then
?
"
"
Yes
,
Mary
,
he
's
gone
.
"
That
was
all
he
said
,
and
he
surprised
her
some
.
what
by
walking
quickly
up
the
kitchen
and
into
the
hall
.
He
would
generally
stop
and
have
a
word
or
two
or
listen
to
her
.
He
was
a
good
listener
;
he
was
about
the
only
one
in
the
house
that
was
these
days
.
Everybody
seemed
to
be
in
a
rush
.
It
was
the
war
,
she
supposed
.
She
got
a
bit
lonely
when
she
was
on
by
herself
at
nights
.
Things
were
changing
in
the
house
-
you
could
feel
it
-
and
there
was
trouble
brewing
.
She
had
only
to
look
at
Mrs
Jebeau
's
face
to
see
it
;
in
fact
,
she
could
smell
trouble
in
that
direction
.
She
was
a
funny
woman
,
was
Mrs
Jebeau
,
nervy
;
what
they
called
neurotic
,
she
would
think
.
"
Yes
"
-
she
nodded
to
herself
-
"
that
was
the
word
,
neurotic
,
which
accounted
for
her
nerves
and
her
funny
temper
too
.
"
Going
through
Joe
's
mind
as
he
mounted
the
stairs
were
thoughts
which
were
very
similar
,
except
that
he
expressed
his
in
a
slightly
different
way
.
His
mother
,
he
knew
,
was
in
for
another
of
her
bouts
,
and
he
would
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
it
.
He
should
be
used
to
them
by
now
because
they
had
become
a
frequent
occurrence
during
the
past
few
months
,
particularly
since
Martin
had
been
bringing
Miss
Crosbie
to
the
house
.
He
had
to
think
of
her
as
Miss
Crosbie
so
he
would
n't
again
make
the
mistake
that
had
aroused
his
mother
's
anger
when
he
had
spoken
of
her
as
Marion
.
as
if
he
were
a
child
of
five
she
had
reprimanded
him
,
saying
,
"
Do
n't
be
so
personal
;
she
is
Miss
Crosbie
.
And
do
n't
address
her
by
any
other
name
.
"
It
was
almost
a
running
dive
he
made
across
the
gallery
and
to
his
bedroom
,
but
he
did
it
on
tip-toe
.
He
had
no
doubt
that
his
mother
was
in
her
bedroom
and
that
if
she
heard
him
she
would
come
into
his
room
and
it
would
start
,
he
knew
it
would
:
the
upbraiding
of
Martin
,
and
he
would
n't
be
able
to
stand
it
without
checking
her
.
It
came
to
him
that
he
could
lock
the
door
,
there
was
a
bolt
on
it
,
but
this
conjured
up
the
vision
of
her
battering
on
it
,
for
she
certainly
would
n't
be
deterred
by
the
fact
that
she
was
raising
the
house
;
she
would
know
that
Mary
was
the
only
one
in
it
at
the
moment
.
In
his
room
he
pulled
on
a
dressing-gown
and
sat
down
and
waited
.
He
waited
fifteen
minutes
,
which
seemed
like
hours
,
and
still
she
did
n't
come
.
And
he
knew
she
was
next
door
because
he
had
heard
her
moving
about
.
Half
an
hour
later
he
took
off
the
dressing-gown
and
decided
to
go
downstairs
.
He
was
puzzled
:
he
could
not
understand
this
new
tactic
.
Why
was
she
leaving
him
alone
?
Martin
returned
the
following
evening
.
Harry
had
died
of
pneumonia
after
an
operation
on
his
kidneys
.
Joe
,
looking
dumbly
at
him
as
he
stood
in
the
hall
,
saw
a
man
whose
youth
seemed
to
have
fled
from
him
.
He
was
standing
well
apart
from
them
as
he
gave
Joe
and
his
mother
the
details
,
and
as
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
Joe
sensed
a
great
loneliness
in
his
cousin
that
seemed
to
link
up
with
a
similar
feeling
within
himself
,
and
he
was
drawn
to
Martin
to
put
his
arms
about
him
,
and
when
their
faces
touched
both
were
wet
.
"
Where
's
your
gas
mask
?
"
"
In
its
box
.
"
"
You
'll

once
too
often
.
"
Carrie
slanted
her
eyes
and
nodded
her
head
at
Joe
as
she
added
,
"
And
you
can
get
into
trouble
for
not
carrying
it
.
"
"
That
'll
be
light
to
the
trouble
I
'll
be
in

"
"
What
do
you

"
"

say
it
could
come
any
time

calling
up

"
"
Oh
,
that
.
"
They
stopped
and
faced
each
other
.
Then
Carrie
jumped
aside
as
a
passing
bus
threw
up
some
slush
from
the
gutter
,
and
as
she
brushed
her
hands
down
over
the
bottom
of
her
coat
,
she
said
,
"
You
'd
think
they
did
it
on
purpose
,
"
and
as
he
went
to
assist
her
she
stayed
his
hands
,
saying
,
"
It
'll
only
make
it
worse
.
Anyway
,
what
does
it
matter
?
You
were
saying
about
being
called
up
.
"
They
were
walking
on
again
.
"
Yes

I
was
saying
-
"

to
go
?
"
"
Yes
and
no
.
It
all
depends
where
I
land
.
"
He
stopped
again
and
,
taking
her
firmly
now
by
the
arm
,
pulled
her
into
a
shop
doorway
and
,
looking
into
her
eyes
,
he
said
,
"
If
it
was
n't
for
leaving
you
I
'd
be
glad
to
go

and
I
thought
you
'd
be
proud
of
me
going
.
"
"
Oh
,
Joe
"
-
she
turned
her
head
slowly
to
the
side
-
"

n't
start
on
that
again

"

"
She
pressed
her
lips
tightly
together
for
a
moment
.
"
You
're
asking
the
road
you
know
,
it
's
been
spelled
out
so
many
times

the
rich
man
in

poor

at

,
anyway
,
what
are
you
talking
about

the
rich
man

his
castle

When
Martin
marries

'll
be
out

Mother

She
has
n't
said
anything

she

all
right

wanted

way

's
been
received

At
the

I
can
see
Mother
's
side
of
it
,
at
least
on
this
one
point

she
has

herself
as
being
just
a
housekeeper

these
years

Will

The
question
was
direct
and
he
blinked
for
a
moment
before
answering
:

Yes

he
said

Joe
turned
away
from

,
thrusting
his
hands
deep
into
his
overcoat
pockets

he
sounded
very
like

he
growled
out

turned
on
her
now
,

was
almost
pushed
aside
as
someone
came
out
of
the
shop

so
he
took
her
arm

into

street
again

holding

But
we
can

can

n't

"
Carrie
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
him
,
and
what
she
saw
was
a
young
boy
,
the
same
young
boy
she
had
known
when
she
lived
in
the
cottage
.
She
did
n't
see
the
dark
nineteen-year-old
youth
,
for
he
did
n't
look
nineteen
:
there
was
hardly
any
stubble
on
his
chin
,
his
face
was
pale
,
his
mouth
tender
,
his
clear
grey
eyes
filled
with
the
hurt
of
love
.
She
saw
the
boy
who
wrote
poetry
,
and
she
loved
him
,
but
as
the
boy
,
not
as
the
youth
or
the
budding
man
.
She
thought
of
her
brothers
.
They
had
all
appeared
to
be
like
men
when
they
were
sixteen
,
especially
Mick
.
Mick
had
always
been
like
a
man
to
her
.
Oh
Mick
,
Mick
was
something
.
Oh
yes
,
their
Mick
was
something
.
And
he
understood
Joe
.
He
had
explained
his
character
to
her
by
saying
,
"
He
lives
half
in
the
air
;
it
's
only
his
toes
that
touch
the
ground
.
"
She
remembered
him
laughing
kindly
as
he
said
this
,
because
he
liked
Joe
,
he
liked
Joe
very
much
;
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
guilty
about
him
,
because
in
a
way
he
had
made
use
of
him
as
a
sort
of
cover
.
Her
mind
swung
away
from
her
brother
and
she
told
herself
that
she
could
n't
see
herself
spending
her
life
with
someone
whose
toes
were
just
touching
the
ground
;
her
nature
demanded
stability
.
She
knew
she
had
been
brought
up
these
last
few
years
with
her
Aunt
Alice
and
Uncle
Stan
because
of
the
instability
at
home
.
Of
course
that
had
been
mostly
created
by
the
lack
of
money
,
but
the
instability
she
saw
in
Joe
was
n't
that
kind
of
lack
,
it
was
something
she
could
n't
put
her
finger
on
.
But
Mick
's
description
of
him
sort
of
fitted
.
Yes
;
nevertheless
,
he
was
nice
.
She
liked
him
,
she
liked
him
a
lot
.
Perhaps
she
loved
him
.
She
did
n't
really
know
.
Could
you
love
two
people
-
two
men
like
that
?
There
was
no
answer
.
"
Look
,
Joe
,
I
've
got
to
go
.
"
She
put
out
her
hand
as
if
warding
him
off
.
"
I
'm
late
already
.
"
"
You
-
you
do
n't
care
for

You

n't
even

"
"
Do
n't

She
took
a
step
towards
him
.
"
You
know
I
like
you

But
-
but
I
'm
not
ready
yet

you
want

"
She
knew
she
was
lying
,
and
she
went
on
lying
.
"
I
-
I
do
n't
want
to
be
tied
down
to
anyone
,
and
-
and
things
are
so
uncertain
with
the
war
and
all
that
.
But
-
but
I
do
like
you
,
I
like
you
a
lot
,
Joe
.
Get
that
into
your
head
,
I
like
you
a
lot
.
"
"
But
you
do
n't
love
me
?
"
His
voice
was
flat
.
"
Oh
,
why
must
you
harp
on
about
that
!
Look
,
I
've
got
to
go
.
Bye-bye
.
"
She
backed
two
steps
from
him
,
then
turned
and
ran
towards
the
building
.
He
remained
where
he
was
.
The
weight
in
his
heart
seemed
to
have
tethered
him
to
the
pavement
,
and
he
had
to
force
himself
to
turn
away
,
and
some
seconds
after
she
had
disappeared
through
the
doorway
.
What
would
he
do
without
her
?
He
would
n't
be
able
to
love
anybody
else
but
her
,
ever
.
When
some
part
of
his
mind
prompted
the
words
that
he
had
heard
so
often
,
boyish
fancy
,
his
inside
actually
jerked
in
protest
.
It
was
no
boyish
fancy
,
the
feelings
he
had
for
her
;
they
seemed
to
have
been
born
in
him
.
They
had
lain
dormant
for
some
years
after
she
had
left
the
cottage
,
but
he
knew
now
they
had
simply
been
growing
in
the
warm
darkness
of
his
being
where
love
bred
-
He
had
to
meet
Martin
at
four
o'clock
and
he
had
to
kill
time
till
then
.
He
did
so
by
wandering
the
streets
,
and
when
for
the
second
time
he
passed
the
food
office
where
she
worked
,
he
knew
what
he
was
going
to
do
.
He
was
going
to
face
up
to
his
mother
when
he
got
home
and
have
it
out
.
If
he
could
convince
her
that
nothing
she
could
say
or
do
would
make
him
change
his
mind
about
Carrie
,
the
way
would
be
open
for
him
to
prove
to
Carrie
he
had
enough
love
for
the
two
of
them
.
But
there
was
so
little
time
left
now
,
for
he
could
get
his
papers
any
day
-
He
had
the
urge
to
run
.
He
had
been
so
quiet
on
the
journey
home
that
Martin
said
to
him
,
"
What
's
up
,
laddie
?
"
and
when
Joe
had
replied
,
"
Everything
,
"
Martin
had
nodded
his
head
,
saying
simply
,
"
Carrie
?
"
It
had
been
almost
a
minute
before
Joe
replied
,
"
Yes
,
Carrie
.
"
"
Well
,
better
finish
it
now
,
laddie
,
because
no
good
will
come
of
you
marrying
into
that
lot
.
Oh
,
I
know
,
I
know
.
"
He
had
taken
one
hand
from
the
wheel
and
held
it
up
in
protest
.
"
She
's
a
nice
girl
,
what
I
've
seen
of
her
,
the
best
of
the
bunch
,
I
should
say
,
next
to
Mick
and
,
of
course
,
Dick
.
Old
Dick
's
all
right
,
but
if
you
marry
her
you
'll
be
marrying
her
family
-
Does
she
feel
the
same
way
as
you
?
"
When
Joe
gave
no
immediate
answer
Martin
had
sighed
as
he
said
,
"
There
are
a
lot
of
women
in
the
world
,
laddie
,
thousands
and
thousands
of
"
em
.
And
the
right
one
is
among
them
,
the
right
one
for
you
,
that
is
.
Some
day
you
'll
come
across
her
and
you
'll
know
it
,
as
soon
as
you
look
at
her
,
you
'll
know
it
.
As
I
know
it
.
Something
goes
bang
inside
your
belly
.
And
as
often
as
you
tell
yourself
she
's
not
your
type
,
that
you
do
n't
like
blondes
,
your
taste
tends
towards
the
browns
,
even
redheads
but
not
blondes
,
no
;
and
what
's
more
,
her
face
is
round
,
but
you
do
n't
like
round
faces
;
and
you
've
always
gone
in
for
a
bit
of
shape
and
she
's
flat
as
a
pancake
.
You
're
not
having
any
of
that
,
you
tell
yourself
,
but
you
're
hooked
,
laddie
,
you
're
hooked

"
He
had
glanced
laughingly
at
Joe
,
and
Joe
had
known
he
was
describing
his
future
wife
,
but
his
words
had
brought
no
consolation
to
him
-
It
seemed
to
Joe
that
his
mother
was
waiting
behind
the
hall
door
for
him
,
because
no
sooner
had
he
entered
the
house
than
there
she
was
,
staring
at
him
over
the
distance
.
"
I
want
you
upstairs
a
moment
,
"
she
said
.
Her
voice
was
quiet
,
controlled
.
He
turned
his
head
and
glanced
to
where
Martin
was
taking
off
his
overcoat
,
and
Martin
raised
his
eyebrows
,
pursed
his
lips
and
nodded
his
head
,
the
action
saying
,
"
You
're
in
for
it
again
,
laddie
.
"
By
the
time
he
reached
the
gallery
his
mother
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
broad
corridor
,
but
she
was
n't
going
into
her
room
or
into
his
room
,
she
was
making
for
the
attic
stairs
,
and
now
it
was
his
turn
to
raise
his
eyebrows
.
What
on
earth
did
she
want
him
up
there
for
?
But
he
knew
why
the
moment
he
entered
the
old
schoolroom
,
for
after
allowing
him
to
pass
her
she
closed
the
door
and
stood
with
her
back
to
it
,
her
pale
face
,
now
tinged
to
a
deep
red
,
thrust
out
towards
him
as
she
cried
,

She
shut
up
and
her
mouth
fell
into
a
gape
,
the
sweat
appeared
in
globules
on
her
upper
lip

the
colour
deepened
in
her
face

she
seemed
to
have
to
force
breath
into
her
lungs

she
listened

taken
a

She
blinked
rapidly
now
;
then
,
her
face
becoming
suffused
with
an
anger
that
seemed
to
send
out
rays

heat

The

"
While
they
glared
at
each
other
he
recalled
that
Carrie
had
said
something
similar
earlier
in
the
day
.
"
Do
n't
be
stupid
.
"
She
was
biting
on
her
lip
now
as
if
regretting
her
words
;
then
she
added
,
"
It
is
n't
every
woman
that
can
bear
a
child
,
and
she
does
n't
look
a
child-bearer
to
me
.
And
I
have
a
feeling-
"
She
now
drew
in
a
long
breath
before
resuming
"
And
it
's
more
than
a
feeling
,
it
's
a
certainty
that
,
although
we
're
leaving
here
,
being
forced
to
leave
here
,
we
'll
return

this

our
home

-
if
everyone
had
their
rights

should
be
legal
mistress

this
place
now
.
Whether
you
've
known
it
or
not

I
was
your
uncle
's
mistress
for
years
,
and
he
would
have
married
me
.
Yes
,
yes
,
he
would
.
"
She
nodded
her
head
before
adding
,
"
But
a
man
ca
n't
marry
his
brother
's

was
a
dirty
quirk

I
repeat
,

'll
come

here
one
day
.

"
She
thumped
her
chest
.
When
she
stopped
speaking
his
feeling
of
animosity
towards
her
seeped
from
him
,
and
the
pity
that
he
always
felt
for
her
again
rose
to
the
surface
and
for
a
moment
he
himself
knew
the
extent
of
her
frustration
and
the
reason
behind
her
furious
tantrums
when
she
had
known
his
uncle
was
going
to
marry
again
.
He
could
see
now
that
she
was
placed
in
an
almost
similar
position
,
for
with
Martin
marrying
,
she
was
once
more
being
cast
adrift
.
He
thought
for
a
moment
that
if
she
would
only
accept
his
feelings
for
Carrie
he
would
go
to
her
this
minute
and
put
his
arms
about
her
and
comfort
her
,
but
he
knew
she
would
never
accept
Carrie
.
But
then
Carrie
had
n't
accepted
him
,
had
she
?
So
what
was
stopping
him
from
going
to
her
and
telling
her
that
she
had
no
need
to
worry
?
Whatever
it
was
,
it
was
like
a
wall
between
them
and
he
was
honest
enough
to
admit
to
himself
that
most
of
the
time
he
was
building
on
it
brick
by
brick
in
order
to
blot
her
out
of
his
sight
-
forever
.
He
watched
her
now
lean
against
the
door
,
her
body
slumped
,
her
eyes
closed
.
Of
a
sudden
she
looked
old
.
She
was
forty-six
:
her
face
was
unlined
,
her
hair
still
golden
without
grey
in
it
,
her
body
trim
,
very
trim
,
yet
he
seemed
to
be
looking
at
an
old
woman
.
Pity
for
her
again
seeped
through
until
,
opening
her
eyes
,
she
said
,
and
in
a
quiet
appealing
voice
now
,
"
Promise
me
,
Joe
,
you
wo
n't
see
that
girl
again
.
"
It
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
say
,
"
I
'll
do
no
such
thing
,
"
but
he
found
himself
compromising
by
saying
,
"
I
'm
going
to
join
up
.
"
"
You
're
going
to
what
?
"
"
Join
up
.
"
She
moved
her
head
slowly
now
and
seemed
to
be
making
an
effort
to
speak
,
and
then
she
muttered
,
"
You
'll
be
getting
your
calling
up
papers
eventually
,
in
any
case
,
so
why
-
?
Please
.
"
She
now
straightened
up
and
extended
her
hand
towards
him
,
and
again
she
said
,
"
Please
"
-
then
added
his
name
-
"

.

n't

's

"
He
turned
from
her
now
,
shaking
his
head
,
saying
,
"
I
'm
-
I
'm
sorry
but
-
but
I
must
do
it
.
"
He
had
his
back
to
her
and
he
stood
waiting
for
another
outburst
,
but
when
neither
answer
nor
movement
came
to
him
he
turned
his
head
slowly
and
looked
at
her
over
his
shoulder
.
She
was
standing
straight
,
looking
in
his
direction
but
seemingly
through
him
,
and
the
strange
look
on
her
face
brought
him
around
fully
,
and
he
was
about
to
speak
,
not
with
the
intention
of
giving
her
the
true
version
of
why
he
wanted
to
volunteer
,
for
it
was
n't
in
him
to
hurt
her
to
that
extent
,
but
she
turned
from
him
and
,
quietly
opening
the
door
,
went
out
.
Her
exit
caused
him
more
concern
than
if
she
had
made
it
in
the
blaze
of
anger
similar
to
that
with
which
she
had
first
confronted
him
.
He
put
a
hand
to
his
brow
and
now
out
of
all
she
had
said
there
came
into
his
mind
her
words
:
"
You
could
n't
support
a
rabbit
.
"
And
they
stabbed
at
him
and
caused
his
whole
body
to
tremble
as
if
in
shame
because
,
in
a
way
,
he
knew
she
was
right
:
his
inadequacy
to
face
his
future
was
there
for
even
himself
to
see
;
he
had
considered
volunteering
in
order
to
avoid
the
responsibility
of
making
the
choice
either
of
going
to
University
to
read
for
a
degree
in
English
Literature
or
of
just
plumping
for
a
teacher
's
training
college
course
.
Why
was
life
like
this
?
There
was
a
high
wind
blowing
.
The
night
had
turned
rough
and
the
rattle
from
the
windows
had
seemed
to
be
emphasised
by
the
silence
during
supper
.
They
had
almost
finished
eating
when
Martin
spoke
.
as
if
following
up
a
train
of
thought
,
he
looked
across
at
Joe
,
saying
,
"
I
wonder
if
those
thieving
scoundrels
will
be
on
the
prowl
again
tonight
?
"
and
Joe
answered
,
"
I
should
n't
think
they
'd
have
the
nerve
to
make
a
third
trip
,
not
in
the
same
week
,
anyway
.
"
"
Those
beggars
have
got
the
nerve
and
cunning
to
tackle
anything
.
But
there
's
one
thing
sure
,
next
time
they
come
on
this
land
they
'll
be
met
by
a
reception
committee

yes

"

's
on
tonight

"
"

and
I
've
given
him
orders
to
shoot

be
damned

devils
can
wring
the
necks
of
chickens
and
slit
the
throats
of
sheep

should
n't
object

some
shot

they

"
He
poked
his
head
slightly
towards
Joe
,
and
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
Joe
said
,
"
He
would
really
shoot
them
?
"
"
Yes
,
yes
,
indeed
;

legs

them
down

He
now
thrust
out
his
hand
in
a
flapping
movement
,
saying
,
"
Do
n't
look

nobody

"
Ellen
Jebeau
rose
from
the
table
,
and
they
made
the
gesture
of
rising
too
.
She
was
addressing
Martin
as
she
said
,
"

Martin
had
pulled
himself
up
to
his
feet
now
and
he
held
on
to
the
back
of
the
chair
as
he
nodded
at
her
,
then
watched
her
go
towards
the
door
.
Before
she
reached
it
,
however
,
it
was
opened
and
Mary
entered
the
room
.
Mary
looked
first
at
Ellen
and
then
towards
Martin
as
she
said
,
"

As
the
door
closed
on
both
Ellen
Jebeau
and
Mary
,
Martin
turned
to
the
table
and
as
he
sat
down
said

No

is

-
he
sighed
-
"

's
the

He
turned
to
look
at
the
clock
.

He
rose
to
his
feet
now
,
smiling
and
,
putting
an
arm
around
Joe
's
shoulder
,
he
said
,
"
What
are
you
going
to

"
"

They
went
into
the
hall
together
;
then
Joe
watched
Martin
take
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
,
and
the
maleness
of
him
,
his
virility
seemed
to
leave
an
aroma
behind
him
.
He
remained
standing
looking
up
the
stairs
.
He
wished
he
could
be
like
Martin
,
if
only
in
some
small
way
,
because
he
had
the
feeling
he
lacked
something
.
"
You
could
n't
support
a
rabbit
.
"
Was
it
because
his
mind
tended
towards
thinking
about
things
,
musing
over
them
instead
of
tackling
them
?
Or
was
there
a
deficiency
in
his
make-up
in
the
maleness
of
him
?
No
.
No
.
His
whole
body
jerked
in
denial
as
he
made
for
the
drawing-room
.
He
was
male
all
right
.
Inside
he
knew
he
was
very
male
:
he
wanted
Carrie
and
he
knew
how
he
wanted
her
.
There
was
nothing
airy-fairy
about
the
way
he
wanted
Carrie
:
he
wanted
to
touch
Carrie
,
he
wanted
to
see
her
-
He
turned
on
himself
,
saying
,
"
Oh
God
!
Give
over
!
"
There
was
no
light
in
the
drawing-room
except
that
from
the
fire
,
which
was
burning
brightly
and
leaving
deep
shadows
in
the
corner
of
the
room
.
He
sat
on
the
chintz-covered
couch
to
the
side
of
the
fireplace
and
,
leaning
his
head
back
,
looked
about
him
.
From
one
dim
object
to
another
he
let
his
eyes
roam
,
and
he
saw
them
all
clearly
:
the
Louis
Quinze
couch
between
the
long
windows
,
the
French
glass-fronted
cabinet
in
the
corner
opposite
,
the
sixteenth-century
iron-bound
chest
standing
in
the
alcove
,
its
lid
flat
against
the
wall
,
held
there
by
a
pyramid
of
logs
.
It
was
a
beautiful
room
.
It
was
home
,
the
only
home
he
could
remember
.
He
was
going
to
miss
it
.
Strangely
,
he
knew
at
this
moment
that
he
'd
miss
this
house
as
much
as
his
mother
would
.
He
also
knew
that
never
in
his
life
would
he
be
in
a
position
to
own
one
like
it
.

Martin
looked
up
into
the
dark
sky
where
now
he
could
see
a
faint
pattern
of
grey
,
scudding
clouds
,
then
whispered
,

Martin
now
leant
his
gun
gently
against
the
thick
bush
of
the
hedge
behind
which
they
were
crouched
and
,
putting
his
hand
into
the
deep
pocket

his
overcoat

he
drew
out
a

unscrewed

silver
top
,
poured
out
a
measure
and
handed
it
to

Dick
did
not
immediately
hand

small
cap
back
to
Martin

,
taking
a
clean
handkerchief
out
of
the
top
pocket
of
his
short
,
thick
coat
,
he
wiped
the
rim
of
it
,

handed
it
back

again

They
had
both
slowly
turned
their
heads
,
which
were
now
very
close
as
they
stared
to
where
a
grassy
bank
rose
to
a
narrow
stretch
of
woodland
that
bordered
the
house
gardens
.
It
was
n't

anyone
would
come

way

the
hen

were
situated
in
the
field
just
beyond
the
hedge

were
there
too

having
been
brought
down
from

ten
of

As
Martin
whispered
his
reply
he
raised
his
head
slightly
above
the
hedge
and
peered
into
the
field
,
where
now
he
could
distinctly
make
out
the
hen
crees
and
the
dark
blobs
of
the
sheep
.
As
a
thought
struck
him
he
dropped
on
to
his
hunkers
again
and
whispered
quickly
,
"

down

we
could
stand
up
by
the
spruce
there

darker

They
had
raised
themselves
but
still
remained
crouched
,
and
were
moving
slowly
by
the
hedge
towards
the
tree
,
when
once
again
Martin
's
attention
was
brought
round
to
the
strip
of
woodland
,
not
by
a
noise
this
time
,
but
by
a
strange
feeling
of
impending
danger
.
But
it
came
too
late
for
him
to
do
anything
about
it
,
for
when
he
straightened
up
and
turned
towards
the
bank
the
bullet
hit
him
in
the
chest
and
his
body
seemed
to
disintegrate
and
fly
in
all
directions
,
and
he
knew
that
death
was
on
him
and
that
it
was
something
that
divided
you
into
a
million
parts
and
each
fragment
screamed
as
it
flung
itself
into
eternity
.
But
as
he
sank
into
Dick
Smith
's
trembling
arms
he
made
no
sound
.
Even
while
Dick
was
lowering
Martin
to
the
ground
,
he
had
his
head
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
dark
blur
standing
out
against
the
night
and
it
was
only
a
matter
of
seconds
before
he
raised
himself
and
his
gun
towards
it
.
But
his
finger
never
pulled
the
trigger
for
he
,
too
,
felt
an
explosion
in
his
chest
and
,
as
if
going
into
a
slow
dive
,
he
dropped
to
the
earth
,
the
gun
still
gripped
in
his
hand
,
and
as
he
died
he
heard
a
voice
yelling
,
"

It
was
half
past
ten
when
Joe
placed
the
iron
fire
screen
in
front
of
the
dying
embers
of
the
fire
and
left
the
drawing-room
.
The
hall
light
was
still
on
but
Martin
would
put
that
out
later
.
The
house
was
very
quiet
.
He
stopped
for
a
moment
and
gazed
about
him
.
It
was
strange
,
but
he
imagined
that
at
such
times
as
this
,
when
there
was
only
himself
and
his
mother
in
the
house
,
the
building
had
left
its
base
and
was
afloat
in
the
air
.
It
was
the
remains
of
a
childish
fancy
,
created
by
a
story
he
had
read
,
but
it
returned
to
him
most
vividly
at
this
moment
.
He
again
sensed
the
wrench
he
was
going
to
feel
at
leaving
this
house
and
never
return
to
it
as
home
-
Then
,
not
of
a
sudden
but
slowly
,
there
crept
through
his
being
the
most
odd
feeling
:
his
stomach
began
to
tremble
,
as
if
his
bowels
had
become
loose
in
their
casing
.
No
part
of
his
mind
said
,
"
It
's
silly
to
feel
like
this
about
leaving
the
house
,
"
because
he
knew
that
this
feeling
was
n't
in
any
way
connected
with
his
leaving
the
house
.
Suddenly
he
became
vitally
aware
that
there
was
someone
in
the
hall
with
him
.
He
did
n't
swing
round
but
,
his
thoughts
seeming
to
direct
him
,
he
moved
slowly
,
turning
a
full
circle
,
and
he
gazed
about
him
,
his
eyes
stretched
wide
.
Had
the
house
actually
left
the
ground
,
he
knew
that
he
could
n't
have
felt
more
strange
than
he
did
at
this
moment
,
or
more
afraid
:
there
was
someone
here
.
Had
the
poachers
been
chased
and
found
their
way
into
the
house
?
No
,
no
;
it
was
n't
someone
that
was
here
,
it
was
some
thing
.
He
was
feeling
pain
now
and
a
great
,
great
sadness
.
He
could
n't
bear
it
.
Of
a
sudden
he
was
running
,
flying
up
the
stairs
.
At
the
top
he
stopped
,
brought
to
a
halt
by
the
sight
of
his
mother
entering
her
room
.
He
had
the
impression
that
she
was
fully
dressed
but
told
himself
that
it
must
be
a
trick
of
the
light
.
He
felt
odd
,
queer
,
as
if
he
'd
had
a
bad
dream
.
He
walked
slowly
now
towards
the
room
,
but
as
he
passed
his
mother
's
door
he
felt
forced
to
stop
and
knock
,
not
because
he
wanted
to
see
her
particularly
,
but
because
there
was
a
great
need
in
him
for
human
company
.
He
wanted
to
speak
to
someone
and
hear
their
voice
speaking
to
him
.
There
was
no
answer
to
his
knock
,
so
he
knocked
again
;
and
then
her
voice
came
to
him
:
"
Wait
-
wait
a
moment
.
"
It
seemed
as
if
it
were
coming
from
a
long
distance
and
he
waited
for
a
moment
,
and
the
moment
went
into
a
full
minute
,
and
then
slowly
he
opened
the
door
.
She
was
in
bed
lying
on
her
back
,
and
as
he
crossed
the
room
towards
her
he
noticed
a
number
of
strange
things
.
Her
woollen
hat
was
lying
on
a
chair
:
she
was
a
tidy
woman
,
over-tidy
;
there
was
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
,
was
her
motto
.
And
her
outdoor
boots
were
sticking
out
from
under
the
bed
.
What
drew
his
eyes
down
to
them
was
the
fact
that
it
was
a
strange
place
for
them
to
be
.
And
they
were
wet
.
He
moved
slowly
up
by
the
side
of
the
bed
,
and
now
he
said
,
"
Are
-
are
you
all
right
?
"
and
he
saw
the
bedclothes
that
she
was
holding
under
her
chin
rise
and
fall
with
the
movement
of
her
neck
before
she
said
,
"
Yes
.
I
-
I
was
asleep
.
"
At
this
his
lower
jaw
fell
slightly
and
his
head
came
forward
and
he
said
,
"
You
were
what
?
"
She
did
not
repeat
her
last
statement
but
she
said
,
"
Go
-
go
away
,
please
.
I
-
I
want
to
rest
.
"
Joe
stood
staring
at
her
.
That
strange
feeling
he
had
experienced
in
the
hall
:
had
it
been
repeated
on
the
landing
?
Was
he
having
hallucinations
?
No
,
no
.
He
shook
his
head
at
himself
.
True
,
he
'd
had
that
weird
feeling
in
the
hall
,
but
seeing
her
on
the
landing
a
moment
ago
had
been
no
illusion
.
His
hand
shot
out
now
and
made
an
effort
to
grab
the
bedclothes
from
her
,
but
she
clutched
them
tightly
against
her
throat
.
They
stared
at
each
other
for
a
moment
in
tense
silence
;
then
gripping
the
aide
of
the
bedclothes
,
he
swung
them
upwards
and
exposed
to
his
amazed
gaze
her
grey
outdoor
coat
.
It
was
crumpled
and
wet
in
parts
.
Once
more
he
was
overcome
with
a
strange
feeling
,
but
this
he
could
recognise
,
for
it
was
made
up
of
unadulterated
fear
.
When
she
grabbed
the
clothes
and
put
them
around
her
,
saying
,
"
I
was
cold
;
I
-
I
often
sleep
in
my
coat
,
"
he
backed
away
from
her
,
all
the
way
towards
the
door
;
then
on
the
landing
,
and
for
no
reason
that
he
could
give
to
himself
,
he
turned
and
ran
not
towards
his
bedroom
but
across
the
landing
,
over
the
gallery
,
down
the
stairs
,
through
the
hall
to
the
front
door
.
There
he
stood
leaning
against
it
,
his
arms
outspread
,
one
cheek
pressed
on
to
the
black
wood
,
with
his
breath
coming
in
gasps
,
as
if
he
had
just
surfaced
from
drowning
.
A
minute
later
he
had
wrenched
open
the
door
and
was
standing
on
the
terrace
.
The
night
seemed
light
,
the
moon
was
scudding
between
white
clouds
,
showing
up
the
white
world
beyond
the
drive
that
had
been
cleared
of
snow
.
He
drew
in
deep
,
deep
breaths
of
air
;
then
,
almost
quietly
now
,
he
told
himself
he
must
find
Martin
.
He
must
talk
to
Martin
-
Perhaps
he
was
going
mad
.
Was
he
going
mad
?
No
,
no
;
he
was
n't
going
mad
.
It
was
no
illusion
:
he
had
pulled
the
clothes
off
her
,
seen
her
lying
in
bed
in
her
outer
clothes
,
and
those
soiled
.
What
was
she
hiding
?
Where
had
she
been
?
He
must
find
Martin
-
he
would
be
down
near
the
chicken
run
-
he
must
speak
to
someone
,
touch
someone
's
hand
,
hear
someone
's
voice
.
He
was
running
again
,
taking
the
short
cut
through
the
gardens
and
towards
the
woodlands
,
calling
now
,
"
Martin
!
Martin
!
Martin
!
"
He
found
Martin
,
and
Mr
Smith
.
Martin
was
lying
on
his
back
,
his
knees
upwards
.
The
moon
was
shining
full
on
his
face
-
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
staring
up
at
it
.
He
was
obviously
quite
dead
.
Mr
Smith
was
lying
on
his
side
.
Joe
slipped
on
the
snowy
slope
as
he
neared
him
,
and
when
his
hand
touched
the
man
's
chin
above
the
collar
of
his
rough
jacket
and
felt
the
sticky
wetness
on
his
fingers
,
he
sprang
up
as
if
he
had
been
stung
by
a
hornet
.
"
Oh
God
!
Oh
God
!
Oh
God
!
"
he
was
yelling
aloud
now
as
he
stumbled
back
towards
Martin
and
then
stood
looking
down
at
him
.
He
tried
to
move
,
but
he
could
n't
until
a
voice
shouted
in
his
head
,
"
Get
help
.
Get
help
,
"
and
then
he
scrambled
up
the
bank
and
raced
like
a
wild
thing
,
screaming
now
,
"
Bernard
!
Mr
Swann
!
Danny
!
Help
!
Help
!
Mary
!
Mary
!
"
He
had
gone
through
all
the
Smiths
'
names
by
the
time
he
reached
the
yard
,
and
it
was
there
that
Danny
Waggett
caught
hold
of
him
.
"
They
're
shot
!
"
Joe
screamed
.
"
They
're
shot
!
Martin
and
Mr
Smith
,
they
're
shot

they
're
shot

Down
in
the
spinney
.
They
're
shot
!
They
're
shot
!
"
At
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
doctor
gave
him
a
sedative
and
he
went
into
a
deep
sleep
,
but
when
he
awoke
he
did
not
speak
to
anyone
,
and
the
police
found
great
difficulty
in
questioning
him
too
.
If
the
war
was
n't
actually
forgotten
,
it
was
put
aside
for
a
few
days
in
the
district
around
Screehaugh
.
Until
the
day
of
the
funeral
,
men
and
the
police
searched
the
grounds
and
land
around
hoping
to
find
the
murder
weapon
.
Neither
Sir
Martin
Jebeau
's
gun
nor
that
of
his
stableman
,
Richard
Smith
,
had
been
fired
,
and
both
guns
were
found
not
a
yard
from
each
other
.
The
churned-up
snow
around
the
spots
where
both
men
had
died
had
not
helped
the
investigations
either
.
The
immediate
suspects
of
the
murder
were
a
local
man
and
his
son
;
but
both
these
men
could
not
have
had
stronger
alibis
,
for
the
father
was
in
hospital
after
having
an
operation
on
his
hip
bone
,
while
his
son
had
three
days
previously
been
called
into
the
Forces
.
The
second
suspect
was
a
resident
of
Consett
,
but
on
the
night
in
question
his
wife
had
given
birth
to
their
first
child
,
and
the
doctor
and
the
midwife
both
vouched
for
the
fact
that
the
man
had
never
left
the
house
after
he
came
in
from
work
at
half-past
five
until
he
went
to
work
the
next
morning
,
an
hour
after
he
had
heard
his
son
first
cry
.
The
police
thought
they
were
on
to
something
when
,
following
an
anonymous
"
phone
call
,
they
went
to
a
butcher
's
shop
.
The
voice
on
the
telephone
had
informed
the
police
the
butcher
was
in
the
habit
of
buying
stolen
sheep
and
fowl
.
The
police
spent
two
days
trying
to
persuade
the
butcher
to
give
them
the
name
or
names
of
his
supplier
.
When
,
worn
down
at
last
,
he
mentioned
a
man
who
lived
as
far
away
as
Prudhoe
,
the
polite
picked
up
a
young
fellow
known
as
Billy
the
Badger
,
which
apparently
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
poaching
activities
,
but
was
given
him
because
he
always
wore
a
white
muffler
,
the
ends
tucked
into
his
trouser
tops
,
and
on
Sundays
,
when
he
wore
his
best
,
which
was
a
black
coat
and
trousers
,
his
pointed
face
above
this
ensemble
roughly
depicted
the
night
creature
of
the
woods
.
Billy
the
Badger
had
much
more
difficulty
in
proving
his
innocence
,
although
he
admitted
to
stealing
chickens
.
Yes
,
he
said
,
he
had
raided
at
Screehaugh
,
but
only
for
chickens
.
He
swore
he
had
never
touched
their
sheep
,
and
he
swore
by
many
Northern
oaths
that
he
was
in
Newcastle
up
till
eleven
o'clock
on
the
night
of
the
murders
.
It
took
some
further
persuasion
to
elicit
exactly
where
he
had
spent
the
hours
in
Newcastle
.
"
Pubs
,
"
he
had
said
briefly
at
first
.
When
he
found
this
was
n't
good
enough
for
the
police
,
the
result
of
speaking
the
truth
being
the
lesser
of
two
evils
,
he
gave
the
name
of
a
woman
he
had
visited
.
What
happened
when
he
faced
his
wife
and
when
the
husband
of
the
lady
in
question
,
who
was
in
the
Forces
,
heard
of
her
escapade
,
did
n't
reach
the
papers
.
There
was
a
war
on
and
such
emotional
family
matters
were
really
of
no
account
.
The
police
went
on
searching
.
They
would
find
the
culprits
.
But
they
were
hampered
by
the
fact
that
the
stealing
of
hill
sheep
at
this
time
was
becoming
a
common
occurrence
.
During
the
five
days
between
that
dreadful
night
and
the
day
of
the
funeral
,
Joe
and
Ellen
Jebeau
never
looked
at
each
other
,
nor
did
a
word
pass
between
them
.
There
were
no
set
meals
;
the
whole
Smith
family
was
deeply
affected
and
Mary
and
Helen
did
only
what
was
absolutely
necessary
.
They
cried
a
lot
,
and
Jesie
Smith
,
appearing
in
the
kitchen
more
than
she
had
done
in
recent
months
,
not
only
cried
but
wailed
,
nearly
always
when
Joe
was
within
earshot
,
and
the
substance
of
her
wailing
was
,
"
Left
without
a
breadwinner
,
"
which
nearly
always
elicited
,
"
Oh
!
Ma
,
be
quiet
,
"
from
Mary
.
It
was
an
understood
thing
that
Mr
Joe
,
Sir
,
as
he
was
now
-
and
that
was
hard
to
take
in
-
was
still
in
shock
,
for
he
walked
about
like
someone
in
a
dream
and
would
stand
staring
in
front
of
him
for
minutes
on
end
.
Mrs
Jebeau
,
too
,
appeared
shocked
.
As
Mary
re-iterated
to
the
police
,
she
'd
had
a
job
to
wake
her
up
out
of
a
dead
sleep
that
night
,
and
when
she
did
come
to
she
just
could
n't
take
in
what
had
happened
:
she
did
n't
seem
able
to
speak
for
ages
and
she
'd
had
to
help
her
into
her
clothes
.
But
in
private
,
Mary
remarked
to
Mick
that
it
was
funny
how
that
one
always
seemed
to
fall
on
her
feet
.
She
had
been
ready
for
the
road
,
then
Mr
Arthur
died
.
And
there
she
had
been
again
,
almost
packed
to
make
way
for
Mr
Martin
's
wife
,
when
once
again
fate
had
taken
a
hand
,
and
now
she
was
set
nicely
.
And
for
good
,
it
would
seem
,
for
she
'd
rule
Mr
Joe
,
title
or
no
title
.
And
poor
Miss
Crosbie
.
It
seemed
that
she
had
been
knocked
silly
too
.
Mary
described
to
Mick
how
the
young
girl
had
stood
in
the
hall
,
her
face
cupped
between
her
palms
,
and
gazed
about
her
,
while
the
tears
ran
down
her
face
and
she
kept
muttering
,
"
Oh
Martin
!
Martin
!
"
Her
mother
and
father
had
had
to
help
her
down
the
steps
and
into
the
car
.
The
house
seemed
fated
somehow
.
What
did
he
think
-
?
Did
he
think
Master
Joe
would
go
off
his
head
?
One
part
of
Joe
was
telling
him
he
had
already
gone
off
his
head
,
but
another
section
kept
repeating
,
"
It
'll
soon
be
over
and
then
you
can
tell
her
.
Once
you
've
done
that
you
'll
be
free
.
"
He
still
had
the
numbed
feeling
on
him
,
and
that
in
itself
was
frightening
,
for
as
yet
he
could
feel
no
sorrow
for
either
Martin
or
Mr
Smith
.
He
knew
that
at
night
,
alone
in
his
room
,
he
should
be
crying
,
but
no
tears
came
;
that
in
itself
was
strange
,
for
he
'd
often
cried
about
small
things
,
such
as
seeing
a
fox
with
its
leg
in
a
trap
,
still
alive
,
its
eyes
begging
for
release
.
He
had
been
too
afraid
and
shocked
to
go
near
it
,
and
on
that
particular
night
he
had
cried
because
of
his
cowardice
.
Then
he
had
cried
one
night
following
a
market
day
in
Hexham
,
for
there
he
had
seen
two
men
fighting
.
It
was
in
a
narrow
side
street
and
there
were
only
a
few
people
watching
.
The
younger
man
had
hauled
his
older
opponent
from
the
ground
and
held
him
up
against
the
wall
with
one
hand
while
he
pummelled
his
face
with
the
other
,
and
the
blood
covered
his
fist
.
When
the
sight
elicited
from
one
of
the
bystanders
,
"
I
know
he
deserves
it
,
but
enough
is
enough
,
and
after
all
,
he
's
his
father
,
"
another
had
answered
,
"
Aye
,
you
've
said
it
:
he
's
his
father
;
but
then
,
the
lass
was
his
wife
.
"
He
puzzled
over
that
,
but
he
kept
remembering
the
older
man
's
face
,
and
the
sadness
in
it
,
and
the
awful
fact
that
he
had
n't
retaliated
in
any
way
.
It
was
something
about
the
old
man
's
attitude
that
had
made
him
cry
.
But
here
he
was
in
a
deep
tragedy
:
the
man
he
had
loved
-
yes
,
really
loved
,
had
been
murdered
,
and
he
could
shed
no
tears
for
him
-
He
was
dry-eyed
at
the
funeral
,
and
there
was
a
great
crowd
there
.
They
came
to
the
house
on
horseback
,
by
car
,
by
bicycle
,
by
farm-cart
;
but
most
of
them
followed
the
hearse
on
foot
;
close
friends
filled
the
four
cabs
.
He
himself
sat
in
the
first
cab
opposite
Martin
's
two
partners
,
Mr
Alex
Beecham
,
the
senior
partner
,
and
Mr
James
Holden
,
now
the
junior
partner
.
Martin
's
position
in
the
firm
had
been
between
the
two
.
The
Smith
mourners
were
all
on
foot
and
there
were
no
women
present
.
Dick
Smith
's
hearse
followed
that
in
which
Martin
lay
.
Joe
had
insisted
on
this
arrangement
despite
Mr
Beecham
's
opinion
that
it
was
n't
quite
seemly
.
The
day
was
cold
,
with
flurries
of
snow
and
people
were
muffled
up
to
the
eyes
.
But
Joe
himself
did
n't
feel
the
cold
;
when
you
were
numb
already
,
the
temperature
made
little
impression
on
you
.
In
the
cemetery
he
became
aware
of
Mick
Smith
walking
by
his
side
,
but
he
did
not
acknowledge
his
presence
in
any
way
.
Later
,
when
like
a
waking
nightmare
,
the
business
was
over
and
he
was
once
again
sitting
in
the
cab
,
Mr
Beecham
leant
towards
him
and
said
,
"
If
you
will
excuse
us
we
will
be
returning
straight
to
Newcastle
,
"
and
paused
before
adding
,
"
Sir
Joseph
,
"
which
remark
drew
the
young
man
's
attention
to
him
.
For
the
first
time
a
sensation
pierced
the
numbness
and
it
caused
Joe
's
body
to
jerk
and
send
a
message
to
his
brain
that
created
the
desire
to
shout
,
"
Do
n't
call
me
that
,
because
I
'm
not
a
sir
.
I
never
was
and
never
shall
be
;
you
've
left
the
sir
in
the
grave
.
"
"
Are
you
all
right
?
"
"
Yes
,
yes
.
"
The
words
were
clipped
.
"
You
said
you
'd
be
leaving
for
Newcastle
?
"
"
We
'd
like
to
make
it
before
dark
.
With
no
lighting
,
the
roads
can
be
rather
treacherous
,
you
understand
,
and
the
weather
is
seeming
to
worsen
.
"
"
Yes
.
"
There
was
a
long
pause
before
Joe
said
,
"
I
want
to
see
you
about
-
about
business
.
"
"
Yes
,
yes
,
anytime
.
"
"
Tomorrow
?
"
Mr
Beecham
's
eyebrows
moved
up
slightly
,
and
he
said
,
"
Yes
,
if
you
wish
,
tomorrow
.
Say
,
eleven
o'clock
?
"
"
Very
well
.
"
Joe
's
reply
was
curt
and
Mr
Beecham
looked
at
this
young
man
who
,
when
he
had
last
seen
him
just
a
few
months
ago
,
had
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
schoolboy
,
immature
for
his
age
:
but
sitting
before
him
now
was
a
young
man
with
no
sign
of
immaturity
on
his
countenance
,
for
he
seemed
to
have
aged
overnight
,
as
it
were
.
The
eyes
held
a
strange
expression
,
and
he
guessed
that
even
though
their
gaze
was
directed
towards
you
their
owner
's
mind
was
on
something
entirely
different
.
He
had
certainly
taken
the
tragedy
badly
.
Doctor
Nesbitt
had
suggested
that
the
shock
had
perhaps
temporarily
deranged
him
,
and
up
till
this
moment
he
had
agreed
with
him
,
but
suddenly
now
the
young
fellow
seemed
to
know
what
he
was
about
.
Strange
how
he
had
given
that
start
when
he
had
addressed
him
as
Sir
Joseph
.
As
yet
he
was
n't
used
to
the
title
;
indeed
,
he
was
perhaps
the
first
to
have
addressed
him
as
such
.
Even
so
,
it
had
taken
some
little
effort
on
his
part
,
for
here
was
this
relatively
obscure
relation
who
had
fallen
into
an
estate
,
which
,
although
small
,
was
of
no
mean
value
,
and
he
had
fallen
into
it
by
a
series
of
dead
men
's
shoes
.
And
that
was
putting
it
plainly
.
As
fate
had
a
habit
of
doing
,
it
had
played
what
he
termed
a
rather
dirty
trick
for
although
Martin
and
his
father
before
him
had
both
found
the
running
of
the
estate
anything
but
easy
as
far
as
money
was
concerned
,
this
young
man
would
be
better
off
than
either
of
them
,
for
Martin
had
only
within
the
last
year
taken
out
two
very
large
policies
on
his
life
,
the
second
when
he
knew
he
was
going
to
be
married
.
He
wondered
if
the
young
man
was
aware
of
this
.
Well
,
he
would
be
tomorrow
morning
.
By
right
and
custom
,
he
himself
and
James
here
should
be
going
back
to
the
house
for
the
reading
of
the
will
,
but
this
very
new
Sir
Joseph
had
made
it
evident
yesterday
that
he
wanted
no
reading
done
in
the
house
and
that
he
would
let
them
know
when
he
wanted
the
matter
dealt
with
.
Well
,
he
had
now
let
them
know
,
and
tomorrow
morning
he
'd
be
interested
to
see
what
his
reactions
were
.
"
So
there
it
is
.
"
Mr
Beecham
placed
the
last
sheet
of
stiff
paper
on
top
of
a
number
of
others
and
raised
his
gaze
again
to
Joe
,
who
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
,
and
continued
,
"
There
is
no
obstacle
to
your
inheritance
,
as
I
can
see
.
The
insurance
company
,
in
due
course
,
will
settle
the
policies
.
These
were
a
very
fortunate
investment
.
"
He
coughed
,
then
went
on
,
"
They
wo
n't
make
you
entirely
independent
,
but
they
will
ease
any
worry
about
the
maintenance
of
the
house
and
estate
.
And
as
time
goes
by
,
your
staff
will
likely
decrease
,
for
the
age
limits
of
call-up
will
rise
.
You
have
two
men
there
under
forty
,
is
n't
that
so
?
"
"
Yes
-
Yes
.
"
Joe
straightened
his
back
against
the
wooden
chair
,
at
the
same
time
reaching
out
and
placing
one
hand
flat
on
the
edge
of
the
long
polished
table
and
,
looking
across
at
Mr
Beecham
and
James
Holden
,
who
sat
by
his
side
,
he
said
slowly
but
firmly
,
"
I
have
no
intention
of
-
of
living
in
the
house
after
today
.
I
've
volunteered
for
the
Air
Force
.
And
should
I
survive
the
war
,
I
wo
n't
live
there
even
then
.
But
I
wish
to
leave
the
control
of
the
estate
in
your
hands
as
sort
of
legal
guardians

You
will
pay

staff
have

on

grounds
in
order

-
"
"
But
-
but
-
"
Mr
Beecham
leant
forward
over
the
desk
now
,
his
hand
on
the
blotter
in
line
with
that
of
Joe
's
,
and
he
said
two
words
:
"
Your
mother
?
"
Joe
now
withdrew
his
hand
from
the
desk
and
,
rising
to
his
feet
,
he
looked
down
on
to
the
upturned
faces
of
the
two
men
and
said
,
"
My
mother
may
remain
in
the
house
as
long
as
she
wishes
,
but
the
running
of
it
,
the
accounts
and
such
,
I
wish
to
leave
in
your
control
.
Mary
Smith
will
act
as
housekeeper
and
she
will
submit
all
bills
to
you
.
"
He
now
watched
both
men
rise
simultaneously
to
their
feet
,
and
it
was
James
Holden
who
,
turning
to
his
partner
,
said
almost
in
a
whisper
,
"
Her
-
her
allowance
?
"
On
this
Mr
Beecham
,
nodding
now
,
spoke
in
a
small
voice
:
"
We
will
continue
her
allowance
?
"
"
No
.
"
"
I
said
no
.
She
can
live
in
the
house
under
those
conditions
or
go
.
It
's
up
to
her
.
"
There
was
silence
between
the
three
of
them
for
a
moment
as
they
returned
each
other
's
stare
;
then
Joe
said
,
"
If
you
do
n't
wish
to
act
for
me
I
can
make
other
arrangements
.
"
Mr
Beecham
's
voice
was
stiff
now
as
he
replied
,
"
We
have
always
acted
for
the
house
and
I
shall
be
happy
to
continue
doing
so
.
But
,
nevertheless
,
I
must
say
that
I
find
your
orders
rather
disconcerting
.
"
Again
there
was
silence
between
them
,
but
as
Mr
Beecham
stared
at
this
young
man
,
he
remembered
Martin
hinting
that
his
aunt
kept
the
young
boy
on
a
tight
rein
;
and
he
also
went
further
back
and
recalled
Arthur
's
confidence
and
how
he
had
once
described
his
sister-in-law
as
a
frantic
leech
.
Perhaps
the
young
man
had
something
on
his
side
after
all
.
But
his
measures
were
definitely
drastic
,
smacking
somewhat
of
retaliation
.
"
Good-day

thank
you

One
thing
more
,

you
write

me

The
two
older
men
made
no
reply
to
this
,
and
neither
of
them
moved
towards
the
door

open
it

did
they

Good-day

Joe
walked
out
of
the
offices
into
the
thick
driving
snow
.
The
fact
that
he
turned
his
collar
up
against
the
seeping
cold
indicated
that
his
numbness
had
been
penetrated
,
yet
he
was
unaware
of
it
.
He
was
well
on
his
way
to
the
station
when
he
paused
and
looked
up
towards
a
building
,
and
he
saw
in
his
mind
's
eye
Carrie
running
up
the
steps
,
and
he
recalled
her
voice
saying
,
"
Oh
!
why
must
you
keep
on
about
that
.
"
The
word
"
that
"
to
which
she
was
referring
was
love
.
How
long
ago
was
it
?
Days
or
years
?
Had
he
ever
loved
anybody
?
Yes
,
he
had
loved
Martin
and
Harry
and
his
Uncle
Arthur
.
He
seemed
to
love
people
more
when
they
were
dead
.
But
no
,
he
had
indeed
loved
them
when
they
were
alive
.
But
there
was
nobody
left
to
love
now
,
and
that
was
a
good
thing
.
Never
,
never
again
in
his
life
would
he
say
he
loved
anybody
,
for
love
was
a
destroyer
,
love
was
a
madness
that
turned
people
into
fiends
and
devils
.
He
was
going
back
now
to
confront
one
,
one
who
supposedly
did
what
she
did
out
of
love
,
and
strangely
he
was
no
longer
afraid
.
When
your
whole
being
was
overflowing
with
loathing
and
hate
there
was
no
room
for
fear
.
He
said
to
Mary
,
"
Where
is
she
?
"
not
,
"
Where
is
my
mother
?
"
"
Up
in
her
room
,
Mr
Joe
-
"
Mary
was
finding
it
difficult
to
change
her
way
of
addressing
this
new
master
.
She
had
never
yet
addressed
him
as
Sir
Joseph
,
because
somehow
he
did
n't
look
like
a
sir
;
he
did
n't
,
in
her
eyes
,
fit
the
title
;
he
was
too
young
.
Yet
she
had
to
admit
he
had
changed
over
the
last
few
days
.
By
!
he
had
that
,
and
in
more
ways
than
one
.
She
did
n't
like
to
own
up
to
the
fact
that
she
now
stood
a
little
in
awe
of
him
,
and
she
had
never
felt
like
that
with
either
Mr
Martin
or
his
father
before
him
because
,
in
their
own
ways
,
they
had
both
been
free
and
easy
.
Leaving
Mary
staring
after
him
,
Joe
ran
up
the
stairs
,
crossed
the
gallery
,
and
went
straight
to
his
mother
's
bedroom
.
He
did
n't
knock
,
but
paused
for
a
moment
before
opening
the
door
.
She
was
sitting
by
the
window
at
a
little
table
she
used
as
a
writing
desk
,
and
she
jerked
round
as
he
entered
the
room
,
but
she
did
n't
rise
.
Neither
did
he
move
from
where
he
was
standing
,
just
inside
the
door
,
for
almost
a
minute
;
and
when
he
did
,
he
came
quickly
to
the
side
of
the
table
and
stood
within
an
arm
's
length
of
her
.
Again
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
,
and
then
he
said
very
slowly
,
"
I
've
been
to
see
Beecham
and
Holden
.
I
've
made
arrangements
with
them
how
the
estate
is
to
be
run
.
You
,
Mother
,
may
stay
or
go
,
but
you
'll
have
no
control
of
any
of
the
affairs
,
either
outside
or
inside
the
house
.
You
can
eat
free
and
sleep
free
,
but
that
's
as
far
as
your
privileges
will
extend
,
ever
.
Do
you
understand
?
"
He
watched
her
mouth
fall
open
,
then
he
saw
her
upper
lip
twitch
and
her
eyelids
flutter
;
then
she
muttered
,
"
No
!
no
!
you
ca
n't
do
it
.
"
Her
words
were
scarcely
audible
.
"
I
've
done
it
-
Will
you
stay
?
"
He
bent
towards
her
now
.
"
You
'll
have
plenty
of
company
:
three
dead
men
and
a
woman
.
"
They
were
staring
into
each
other
's
eyes
now
,
both
mouths
agape
.
"
You
fixed
the
car
,
did
n't
you
;
Vanessa
Southall
's
car
?
You
did
n't
expect
Uncle
to
be
in
it
-
And
then
Martin
was
going
to
marry
,
was
n't
he
?
"
His
voice
was
no
more
than
a
faint
whisper
now
but
it
was
as
if
his
words
were
spraying
vitriol
on
her
face
,
because
she
tossed
her
head
from
side
to
side
as
if
throwing
off
the
spray
.
"
You
could
n't
bear
the
thought
,
could
you
,
of
that
girl
,
that
nice
young
girl
,
being
mistress
here
?
you
told
yourself
it
was
for
me
,
all
for
me
.
"
"
It
was
,
it
was
.
"
Her
lips
mouthed
the
words
but
no
real
sound
came
from
them
.
"
You
thought
he
was
on
his
own
,
did
n't
you
?
You
did
n't
count
on
Dick
being
so
conscientious
that
he
would
n't
let
Martin
watch
alone
.
"
He
put
out
his
hand
towards
her
now
but
did
n't
touch
her
,
saying
,
"
Do
n't
faint
;
it
wo
n't
help
you
any
because
I
'll
only
revive
you
with
a
jug
of
cold
water
and
make
you
listen
to
the
finish
.
"
Where
have
you
hidden
the
gun
?
Where
have
you
put
it
,
eh
?
I
know
every
gun
in
that
room
.
I
used
to
help
Martin
clean
them
.
But
the
police
never
thought
to
ask
if
there
was
one
missing
,
because
the
lady
of
the
house
was
fast
asleep
in
bed
,
was
n't
she
?
And
there
was
only
the
maidservant
and
me
.
They
could
even
have
suspected
me
had
they
not
found
the
two
sets
of
footprints
in
the
soft
snow
right
up
to
the
very
hedge
where
Martin
was
hiding
.
The
poachers
had
already
been
and
got
away
with
their
spoils
;
or
when
they
heard
the
shots
,
they
made
off
.
We
'll
never
know
,
will
we
?
But
you
know
something
,
Mother
?
"
His
face
was
hanging
over
hers
now
.
"
I
could
commit
murder
at
this
very
minute
.
I
have
a
great
urge
to
throttle
you
,
but
that
would
prove
I
'd
inherited
your
madness
and
I
want
no
trait
of
you
to
show
in
me
,
ever
.
Ever
!
"
He
shouted
the
last
word
;
then
his
voice
dropping
again
,
he
said
,
"
The
very
smell
of
you
nauseates
me
;
you
stink
of
death
.
"
Now
he
drew
himself
upwards
and
stepped
back
from
her
,
and
it
seemed
to
give
her
space
to
breathe
,
for
she
drew
air
into
her
lungs
and
for
the
first
time
she
spoke
,
almost
whimpering
now
:
"
I
-
I
did
n't
do
it
.
It
's
-
it
's
you
who
are
mad
.
And
-
and
you
ca
n't
leave
me
like
this
,
with
nothing
-
My
allowance
.
"
"
You
have
no
allowance
.
I
've
told
you
the
terms
:
you
are
bed
and
board
,
as
the
saying
goes
,
nothing
more
.
And
let
me
tell
you
this
:
should
you
in
any
way
try
to
get
in
touch
with
me
,
even
go
to
the
partners
and
ask
for
my
whereabouts
,
I
swear
before
God
-
"
He
now
raised
his
hand
in
a
dramatic
fashion
and
paused
before
he
added
,
"
See
,
I
'm
taking
an
oath
.
I
swear
before
God
that
I
'll
expose
you
for
what
you
are
:
a
four
times
murderess
.
"
He
took
another
step
backwards
and
stared
at
her
for
a
long
moment
before
saying
,
"
This
is
the
last
time
I
'll
ever
look
on
you
willingly
.
"
"
Joe
!
Joe
!
"
Her
voice
was
cracked
,
coming
like
a
broken
note
from
a
rusty
instrument
;
and
again
she
appealed
to
him
as
she
watched
him
move
towards
the
bedroom
door
.
"
Come
-
come
back
a
minute
.
Oh
Joe
.
Joe
.
"
He
stopped
with
the
door
handle
in
his
hand
and
quietly
said
,
"
Yes
,
I
'll
come
back
some
day
when
you
are
gone
and
I
'll
find
where
you
've
hidden
the
gun

would
n't
have
dared
take
it
outside
this
room
,
would
you
?
And
this
-
"
he
moved
his
arm
slowly
to
the
side
as
he
was
about
to
add
,
"
This
is
going
to
be
your
grave
,
"
but
he
stopped
,
for
two
reasons
;
the
words
sounded
melodramatic
,
like
those
that
might
be
used
in
an
amateur
play
,
and
this
was
no
amateur
play
;
the
second
reason
was
that
he
felt
sick
.
He
Was
stumbling
as
he
walked
across
the
landing
.
There
was
no
sound
from
behind
now
,
and
he
leant
against
the
bannisters
for
a
moment
,
his
upper
body
swaying
over
them
,
and
his
stomach
began
to
heave
.
She
was
insane
.
His
mother
was
insane
,
yet
she
looked
so
normal
,
frail
and
normal
.
But
she
really
was
insane
,
mad
.
And
he
was
her
son
,
he
was
the
son
of
a
mad
woman
.
What
was
in
her
was
in
him
.
No
!
No
!
He
was
running
down
the
stairs
.
Without
stopping
in
the
hall
to
put
on
an
outer
coat
,
he
wrenched
open
the
front
door
,
ran
over
the
terrace
and
down
the
steps
.
It
was
as
he
dashed
along
the
drive
that
Mick
Smith
saw
him
.
Mick
was
walking
slowly
,
a
haversack
and
gas
mask
hanging
from
his
shoulder
.
He
was
on
his
way
back
to
Newcastle
,
but
when
he
saw
Joe
racing
across
the
field
that
bordered
part
of
the
drive
,
he
paused
a
moment
before
deciding
to
follow
him
.
He
did
n't
run
but
hurried
in
the
same
direction
,
and
he
kept
him
in
view
until
Joe
disappeared
into
the
belt
of
woodland
.
When
he
himself
entered
it
he
could
n't
see
him
ahead
or
on
either
side
,
although
in
most
places
the
bracken
and
undergrowth
was
flat
.
It
was
as
he
was
about
to
emerge
from
the
far
end
of
the
wood
that
the
figure
on
the
ground
brought
him
to
a
standstill
.
Putting
down
his
gas
mask
and
haversack
at
the
side
of
a
tree
,
he
walked
slowly
forward
;
then
dropping
on
to
one
knee
,
he
placed
his
hand
on
Joe
's
shoulder
,
and
the
contact
brought
the
younger
man
round
with
a
start
.
"
What
is
it
,
lad
?
"
"
Oh
,
Mick
!
Mick
!
"
It
was
an
agonised
cry
.
And
then
he
was
lying
face
downwards
again
,
his
knuckles
pressed
into
his
mouth
,
trying
to
smother
the
fearful
sounds
that
were
erupting
from
his
being
.
When
the
tears
sprang
from
his
eyes
and
nose
and
his
body
shook
as
with
an
ague
,
Mick
put
his
arms
about
him
and
,
pulling
him
round
,
cradled
him
as
he
would
a
child
,
saying
,
"
There
!
There
!
Let
it
up
,
an'
out

It
's
over

It
's
over

's
done

done

bring
them
back
.
"
How
long
he
lay
against
Mick
he
did
n't
know
;
he
only
knew
that
between
the
sounds
he
had
been
emitting
and
the
wash
of
tears
that
seemed
to
have
drained
him
dry
,
a
voice
within
him
had
kept
repeating
:
"

was
what
he
said
,
however
,
apologising
for
his
tears
.
"
Nothing

Joe
had
hitched
himself
into
a
sitting
position
against
the
bole
of
a
tree
,
and
as
he
wiped
his
face
he
answered
,
"

shook
his
head

Joe
looked
at
the
blue
overcoat
Mick
was
wearing
and
said
,
"

Mick
nodded
his
head
reassuringly
.
Then
glancing
at
his
watch
,
he
said
,
"
Come

Joe
got
to
his
feet
and
he
stood
with
his
head
bent
as
Mick
retrieved
his
things
;
then
slowly
he
joined
him
,
and
together
they
walked
back
through
the
wood
,
silent
now
,
until
they
reached
the
drive
There
,
holding
out
his
hand
,
Mick
said
,
"
You
'll
be
all
right

And
after
all

perhaps

best
thing
you
could
do

Mick
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
,
then
again
he
said
,
"
Goodbye
.
"
And
Joe
answered
"
Goodbye

,
and
they
parted
.
As
Joe
walked
away
he
felt
that
he
had
said
goodbye
to
the
last
phase
of
his
youth
,
and
that
his
storm
of
weeping
had
swept
him
into
manhood
and
away
from
all
connection
with
the
woman
back
in
that
room
.
Yet
he
felt
like
someone
entering
a
foreign
country
without
knowing
anything
about
the
language
.
She
was
standing
in
the
wings
,
leaning
against
a
post
that
supported
a
wooden
framework
,
which
in
turn
held
up
a
number
of
backcloths
.
She
was
just
five
feet
tall
,
and
fat
.
The
Marie
Lloyd
costume
she
was
wearing
:
buttoned
boots
,
feather
boa
,
black-straw
,
flower-trimmed
hat
,
gave
her
the
appearance
of
a
child
dressed
up
as
an
adult
.
She
had
full
view
of
the
stage
and
of
the
three
female
impersonators
,
kicking
up
their
legs
in
a
dance
,
the
rhythm
of
which
had
gone
a
little
awry
.
She
turned
her
head
slightly
as
a
voice
behind
her
said
,
"
If
those
idiots
do
n't
come
off

they
'll
get
booed
.
Five
hundred

"
Maggie
LeMan
lifted
her
shoulders
slightly
and
smiled
as
she
said
,
"
They

"
"
They

The
man
now
bent
his
long
length
down
towards
her
and
said
quietly
,
"
You
tired

Lemon
?
"
As
she
turned
her
face
towards
him
there
was
a
twinkle
in
her
round
brown
eyes
and
a
touch
of
sarcasm
in
her
tone
as
she
answered
,
"
No

no

've
only

up

six

She
turned
round
and
looked
at
the
brass-dialled
clock
sitting
starkly
on
a
red
brick
wall
to
the
side
of
them
and
added
,
"
Only
half-past
eight

"
For
answer
he
pushed
her
in
the
shoulder
,
and
when
she
almost
tipped
over
the
bird
cage
at
her
feet
his
other
hand
came
out
and
,
steadying
her
,
he
laughed
down
into
her
face
as
he
said
,
"
Sarky
little
bitch

n't
you

your
figure

tongue

The
smile
slipped
from
his
face
as
he
said
,
"

What
I

to

he
jerked
his
big
head
to
the
side
-
"

never
open
me
mouth

I
say
something

She
flapped
her
hand
at
him
.
"

n't

that
worry

The
sergeant
was
silent
for
a
moment
;
then
unconsciously
taking
his
tactlessness
a
step
further
,
he
said
,
"
I
always
say
it
's
a
bloody
shame

He
bent
towards
her
again
,
saying
now
,
"

you

he
pulled
a
face
-
"

Maggie
LeMan
kept
her
eyes
riveted
on
the
occupants
of
the
stage
for
a
moment
,
where
they
were
bowing
and
making
the
best
of
the
half-hearted
appreciation
now
being
shown
by
clapping
punctuated
with
cat-calls
;
then
,
slowly
leaning
to
the
side
,
she
picked
up
the
bird
cage
as
she
said
,
"

He
pushed
her
again
and
smothered
a
deep
laugh
as
he
said
,
"

n't

As
the
three
impersonators
left
the
stage
they
,
too
,
were
laughing
,
and
it
was
evident
,
as
Maggie
had
observed
,
that
they
had
enjoyed
themselves
.
Their
painted
lips
were
wide
,
and
they
continued
to
push
up
their
false
busts
as
they
went
past
.
The
sergeant
muttered
a
deep
oath
,
and
Maggie
remarked
,
"

The
sergeant
marched
to
the
middle
of
the
stage
and
when
,
using
what
he
called
his
stage
expertise
,
she
heard
him
say
,
"

three
guesses

"
there
followed
ribald
suggestions
from
different
parts
of
the
hall
.
As
the
hubbub
subsided
he
cried
,
"

Maggie
LeMan

own

She
watched
him
walk
sideways
towards
the
other
end
of
the
stage
,
his
arm
outstretched
in
her
direction
.
The
piano
struck
up

She
stood
poised
for
a
moment
,
stretched
her
mouth
wide
,
licked
her
lips
,
moved
her
shoulders
from
side
to
side
,
then
let
her
body
sway
,
waited
for
the
chorus
to
finish
and
the
verse
to
start
and
she
went
on
.
As
she
assumed
her
drunken
pose
and
shambled
towards
the
centre
of
the
stage
,
she
was
deafened
for
a
moment
by
the
clapping
and
the
shouting
;
and
different
names
came
to
her
ears
,
all
meant
for
her
:
"

old

She
waited
.
The
pianist
softened
his
key
.
It
seemed
that
he
had
stopped
playing
.
She
looked
over
the
packed
hall
,
from
the
front
seat
where
sat
Group
Captain
Peasmarsh
and
his
Wing-Commanders
,
through
the
different
grades
,
all
merged
into
a
dusty
blue
mass
dotted
with
white
blobs
.
She
kept
up
her
swaying
motion
,
her
mouth
in
a
silly
grin
,
until
there
was
silence
;
and
then
she
began
to
sing
.
Her
voice
,
clear
and
pure
,
soared
up
to
the
roof
of
the
theatre
,
and
when
it
picked
up
the
words
of
the
chorus
of
"
My
old

,
no
one
in
that
vast
hall

in

they
just
listened
.
And
not
a
few
thought
it
was
a
kind
of
desecration
to
use
a
voice
like
that
in
uttering
such
common
words
:
My
old
man
said
"

the
van

my
home

it

walked
behind
with
my
old
cock
linnet
,
But
I
dillied
and
dallied

dallied

dillied

Lost
the
van

n't

When
she
had
finished
,
the
applause
was
deafening
;
as
she
made
her
exit
there
were
cries
of
"

The
sergeant
and
a
young
NAAFI
girl
were
standing
waiting
for
her
.
They
ripped
off
her
hat
,
her
feather
boa
,
her
coat
;
then
she
was
unbuttoning
her
shoes
and
stepping
into
slippers
.
As
she
smoothed
down
her
straight
black
hair
over
her
ears
the
girl
pulled
her
skirt
straight
and
tucked
her
blouse
into
the
back
,
and
she
said
to
her
,
"

Then
turning
her
head
,
she
glanced
up
at
the
sergeant
,
and
with
definite
bitterness
in
her
voice
,
said
,
"

When
she
reappeared
on
the
stage
it
was
to
look
over
a
sea
of
smiling
faces
and
to
listen
to
the
chant
now
of
"

The
pianist
struck
and
held
a
long
opening
chord
,
the
hubbub
died
away
.
And
now
,
her
face
straight
,
her
lips
seeming
to
quiver
,
she
went
into
the
song

so
beautiful
was
her
rendering
of
it
,
so
touching
the
cadences
,
so
tender
with
longing
the
words
,
that
she
seemed
transformed
before
their
eyes

was
no

As
always
when

this

her

were
moist

when

looked
blankly
at

grinning
at

from

and
as
she
pushed
a
cup
of

across
the

she
said

A
roar
went
up
from
those
near
by
and
the
corporal
to
whom
Maggie
had
just
handed
the
tea
,
muttered
,
"
Good
for

He
never

does

?
"
Maggie
did
not
answer
,
but
she
thought
:
no
,
they
never
learn
.
If
they
were
of
a
kindly
nature
they
stayed
that
way
,
if
they
were
narrow
,
tactless
,
or
big-headed
they
stayed
that
way
.
People
did
n't
change
much
.
And
most
of
them
were
blind
,
even
the
decent
ones
,
for
they
never
seemed
to
see
below
the
skin
.
For
a
moment
,
even
while
she
continued
to
dispense
tea
and
wads
,
she
fell
into
the
void
of
loneliness
that
seemed
forever
gaping
at
her
feet
and
from
whose
edge
,
time
and
again
,
she
had
to
forcibly
drag
herself
back
if
she
wanted
to
survive
.
It
was
ironical
that
the
man
she
had
just
rebuked
should
be
the
only
one
who
had
shown
interest
in
her
as
a
woman
during
the
fifteen
months
she
had
been
on
the
station
.
She
had
lost
count
of
the
number
of
times
she
had
slapped
his
hands
from
her
body
whenever
he
waylaid
her
outside
.
He
would
start
with
her
shoulders
and
move
down
to
her
hips
,
and
no
amount
of
disdain
seemed
to
get
through
to
him
.
It
was
unfortunate
also
that
he
was
n't
much
taller
than
herself
.
His
body
was
thick-set
,
but
his
head
was
narrow
and
set
close
to
his
shoulders
.
Yet
he
was
n't
a
bad-looking
man
.
Had
his
character
been
different
she
would
have
welcomed
his
attention
.
Yet
if
his
character
had
been
different
he
would
have
attracted
an
ordinary-looking
girl
.
Almost
constantly
she
longed
to
be
like
ordinary-looking
girls
and
have
a
fellow
,
even
if
,
like
most
attachments
on
the
station
,
it
was
only
a
temporary
affair
.
But
she
knew
she
would
have
to
be
a
great
deal
more
in
need
of
male
company
to
tolerate
anyone
like
Corporal
Billings

"

She
cast
a
withering
glance

Peggy
now
,
then
whispered
back
,
"

As
she
was
about
to
hand
a
cup
to
another
air
man
,
Peggy
happened
to
jostle
her
arm
and
the
tea
sprayed
on
to
the
counter
,
splashing
the
man
on
the
other
side
.
And
as
he
pulled
his
waist
inwards
she
exclaimed
,
"
Oh

'm

pulled
the
half-empty
cup
towards
her
,
and
after
quickly
filling
another
she
passed
it
to
him
,
smiling
at
him
,
saying
again
,
"
Sorry
.
"
But
he
gave
no
answering
smile
.
This
caused
her
to
look
closely
at
him
.
He
was
tall
,
near
six-foot
,
and
he
had
dark
hair
,
black
,
and
deep
grey
eyes
.
He
was
young
,
yet
his
face
somehow
gave
off
the
impression
of
age
.
It
was
n't
that
it
was
lined
or
rugged
,
it
was
the
set
of
his
jaw
and
the
expression
in
his
eyes
.
Her
glance
rested
on
him
only
for
a
matter
of
seconds
,
yet
his
face
could
not
have
registered
more
in
her
mind
had
she
been
staring
at
him
for
an
hour
.
He
made
no
further
remark
but
followed
his
companion
towards
a
table
,
and
she
followed
him
now
with
her
eyes
.
"

They
both
laughed
quietly
at
this
.
The
rush
over
,
Maggie
drew
in
a
long
breath
,
and
turning
to
the
supervisor
who
was
hovering
in
the
background
,
she
asked
,

Before

Maggie
glanced
to

tall
one

He
had
spoken
only
three
words

they
had
sounded
different

was
sensitive

she
went
into
the
rest
room
she
sat
down
for
a
minute
while
waiting
for
Peggy
to
come
out
of
the
lavatory
.
Resting
her
elbow
on
the
table
,
she
let
her
head
fall
on
to
her
hand
,
and
again
she
thought
of
voices
.
A
voice
was
all
she
herself
had
,
and
she
had
inherited
it
from
her
mother
.
That
was
about
all
she
had
inherited
.
Her
mother
had
had
a
beautiful
voice
both
when
she
sang
and
when
she
talked
.
She
could
recall
sitting
listening
to
her
.
She
always
pronounced
the
ends
of
her
words
,
particularly
those
ending
in
"
g
"
.
Even
when
she
was
being
reprimanded
she
had
still
loved
to
listen
to
her
mother
's
voice
.
Voices
were
more
expressive
than
eyes
.
Eyes
could
lie
,
but
voices
could
n't
,
not
really
-
She
could
still
hear
her
mother
's
voice
saying
,
"
Do
n't
sit
looking
at
me
like
that
,
child
;

something
.

You
will
have

you

have
had
to
persuade
your
father
to
fall
in
with
my
wishes
on
this
matter
.
It
was
n't
easy
,
and
it
is
going
to
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
,
and
business
is
not
at
all
bright
at
the
moment
.
People
are
not
wanting
good
furniture
.
The
big
houses
are
selling
up

they
are
in
as
much
dire
distress
financially
as
the
working
classes
.
There
is
little
call
for
antique
furniture
.
So
you
can
understand
what
a
sacrifice
it
is
your
father
is
making
in
sending
you
to
this
school
.
I
have
also
indicated
to
the
headmistress
that
you
take
singing
lessons

have
a

She
never
got
to
the
expensive
school
.
Her
mother
was
killed
in
a
train
accident
and
her
father
,
without
looking
at
her
,
for
he
very
rarely
looked
at
her
,
told
her
that
she
would
continue
at
the
local
school
.
This
she
did
until
she
was
fourteen
.
It
was
in
that
year
her
father
married
again
.
Perhaps
he
could
n't
stand
the
thought
of
her
being
in
the
house
all
day
,
even
though
they
rarely
met
;
and
never
,
never
since
her
mother
died
had
they
eaten
together
.
The
new
stepmother
did
not
take
to
her
,
and
yet
she
could
have
for
she
,
too
,
was
plain
and
had
little
to
recommend
her
except
that
she
had
a
business
head
and
she
knew
about
antiques
and
was
very
good
at
sales
.
Maggie
had
made
herself
useful
to
her
stepmother
by
running
the
house
,
and
yet
continued
to
make
herself
scarce
.
In
a
way
,
the
pattern
of
her
life
was
much
the
same
as
during
the
years
following
her
mother
's
death
:
she
ate
alone
and
as
soon
as
she
heard
her
father
's
key
in
the
door
she
went
upstairs
to
her
room
.
She
was
seventeen
when
her
life
changed
.
She
met
her
aunt
for
the
first
time
and
was
invited
to
spend
a
holiday
with
her
.
She
knew
that
her
father
had
two
sisters
,
although
he
never
kept
in
touch
with
them
.
They
were
common
people
.
So
much
her
mother
had
told
her
about
them
.
She
had
recognised
that
her
father
,
too
,
was
common
,
but
that
he
was
a
good
imitator
:
from
the
time
he
had
taken
up
with
her
mother
,
who
was
from
the
middle
class
,
he
had
aimed
to
act
accordingly
.
But
as
common
as
his
sisters
were
,
the
one
who
had
died
had
become
quite
wealthy
through
a
progressive
small
business
.
She
left
no
will
and
was
unmarried
,
so
because
her
nearest
relatives
were
her
brother
and
sister
,
they
shared
her
estate
.
Her
Aunt
Elizabeth
lived
in
a
small
house
in
the
depths
of
the
country
near
Hereford
,
and
as
she
her
self
had
never
in
her
life
been
outside
of
Birmingham
,
the
journey
was
like
visiting
a
foreign
country
.
She
was
to
stay
a
fortnight
.
At
the
end
of
the
fortnight
she
wrote
to
her
father
,
saying
she
was
n't
coming
back
.
She
received
no
reply
;
nor
had
she
heard
a
word
during
the
five
years
that
had
passed
since
,
and
she
did
n't
know
to
this
day
if
he
was
alive
or
dead
,
and
she
did
n't
care
.
She
had
never
known
what
love
and
tenderness
were
until
she
met
her
Aunty
Lizzie
,
and
she
knew
that
no
one
in
the
world
would
ever
love
her
like
that
woman
did
;
nor
would
she
love
anyone
else
.
In
any
case
she
would
never
get
the
opportunity
.
It
was
n't
only
because
she
was
fat
,
and
it
was
n't
only
because
she
had
no
height
,
and
it
was
n't
only
because
she
was
plain
,
it
was
because
she
was
a
combination
of
all
three

to

public

ran
through

they

into

followed
the

but
what
would
his
reaction
have
been
if
he
had
satisfied
his
curiosity
and
said
,
"
Yes
,
I
have
a
mother
:
she
is
now
living
alone
in
a
manor
house
in
Northumberland
,
"
and
had
gone
on
to
tell
him
,
why
.
He
would
n't
have
believed
it
,
of
course
;
he
'd
likely
have
thought
he
was
mad
.
And
there
were
times
now
,
even
amidst
the
hubbub
of
men
,
when
the
numbness
reared
its
head
again
and
made
him
think
that
eventually
it
would
take
over
and
he
'd
descend
into
silence
,
cold
unthinking
silence
.
Strangely
,
the
prospect
did
n't
frighten
him
as
much
as
daily
living
did
.
"
Look
,
Joe
;
for
the
last
time
,
why
do
n't
you
come
home
with
me
,
if
only
to
prove
to
Alice
you
're
still
on
the
station
.
She
's
getting
suspicious
now
,
and
she
's
saying
,
"
You
do
n't
mean
Josephine
,
do
you

"
As
you
know
,
it
's
no

it
's

'll
make

good
cook

"
I
'm
sure
she

And
what
I
'm
also
sure
of
is
she

n't

Your
leave
's
short
enough

What
's
forty-eight
hours
and
a
good
part
of
it
taken
up
on
the
train
!
It
's
very
good
of
you
,
Len

but
do
n't
worry
yourself
,
I
'm
all
right

"
You

What
's
for
you
here

Cycling
in
the
hills
on
your
own
or
sitting
in
the
NAAFI
!
Look
Joe
-
"
Len
leaned
towards
him
from
where
he
was
sitting
on
the
side
of
his
bed
and
,
lowering
his
voice
,
he
said
,
"
I
do
n't
want
to
probe
,
and
I
know
I
've
said
this
before
,
but
I
-
I
feel
bound
to
bring
it
up
again
.
You
must
have
somebody
,
a
young
fellow
like
you
;
you
say
you
were
n't
brought
up
in
a
home
.
Well
,
you
would
n't
be
,
would
you
,
with
your
education
?
So
is
n't
there
anybody
you
want
to
go
and
see
?
"
Joe
smiled
tolerantly
at
the
man
who
had
made
himself
his
friend
.
In
the
ordinary
course
of
events
he
would
have
said
Len
Forbister
was
n't
the
kind
of
man
to
associate
with
him
.
It
was
n't
that
he
was
a
good
few
years
older
than
him
or
that
,
like
Mick
,
he
had
been
a
working
chap
.
He
had
been
very
fond
of
Mick
,
and
of
his
company
.
But
Len
was
n't
Mick
:
there
was
no
deep
depth
in
Len
;
he
was
an
honest
,
open
fellow
who
was
a
father
of
two
children
and
had
a
good
wife
,
by
the
sound
of
her
.
But
when
that
was
said
,
all
was
said
.
Nothing
about
Len
was
compatible
with
anything
in
himself
.
And
yet
he
had
grown
fond
of
him
,
and
he
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
when
Len
was
away
from
camp
he
missed
him
.
It
was
then
that
the
feeling
of
utter
boredom
would
assail
him
and
he
would
be
driven
to
join
the
crowd
for
the
buses
and
the
queue
for
a
seat
in
the
pictures
in
Hereford
to
pass
the
Saturday
afternoon
away
.
On
Sundays
,
unless
the
weather
was
really
rough
,
he
rode
out
into
the
hills
.
On
these
journeys
,
however
,
he
had
n't
been
fortunate
,
as
some
of
the
fellows
in
the
camp
had
been
,
in
finding
a
cottage
or
a
house
where
they
were
invited
in
to
tea
,
which
often
meant
,
so
he
understood
,
eggs
and
chips
or
even
bacon
,
particularly
if
it
was
a
farmhouse
.
And
he
had
no
inclination
to
spend
his
off-duty
time
working
in
the
jam
factory
that
ran
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
camp
;
he
was
n't
in
need
of
extra
money
.
He
also
knew
that
there
was
a
cure
for
his
loneliness
.
He
was
n't
blind
to
the
fact
that
he
only
had
to
say
,
"
What
are
you
doing
tonight
?
"
and
he
need
n't
be
alone
anymore
.
There
was
that
tall
girl
in
the
NAAFI
.
She
had
looks
too
.
But
he
doubted
if
he
could
have
stood
her
voice
for
a
full
evening
;
it
grated
on
him
when
she
chatted
him
up
over
the
counter
.
Now
if
she
'd
had
the
voice
of
the
little
dumpy
one
they
all
took
the
mickey
out
of
,
Lemon
,
as
they
called
her
,
he
just
might
have
put
the
question
to
her
.
Yet
what
would
have
been
the
result
?
What
would
they
say
about
a
fellow
who
did
n't
make
a
pass
at
them
,
for
to
make
a
pass
you
had
to
feel
something
?
Well
,
he
felt
nothing
,
not
in
that
way
,
and
he
doubted
if
he
ever
would
again
.
He
was
dead
inside
.
All
except
his
head
was
dead
.
It
was
impossible
at
times
to
imagine
that
he
had
been
in
this
camp
all
of
eighteen
months
.
He
had
seen
men
come
and
go
;
squads
of
them
went
through
their
training
and
came
out
bright-eyed
WOP-AIRs
thirsting
to
get
on
to
an
aerodrome
to
finish
their
training
and
then
into
action
.
But
here
and
there
some
found
action
on
this
very
camp
,
and
did
n't
live
to
tell
the
tale
.
They
'd
be
taken
up
in
a
trainer
plane
by
a
pilot
who
had
survived
the
Battle
of
Britain
and
,
as
Len
put
it
,
was
zonked
out
with
combat
.
In
showing
off
to
the
raw
recruits
he
might
even
throw
the
small
plane
into
such
daring
bankings
or
dives
that
it
could
n't
be
manoeuvred
out
of
.
If
they
were
lucky
his
and
his
recruit
's
parachute
might
have
time
to
open
.
But
only
yesterday
one
of
his
own
batch
had
n't
been
so
lucky
,
and
it
was
when
the
news
broke
in
the
camp
that
he
knew
he
could
still
feel
emotion
.
And
Len
had
witnessed
his
reaction
and
this
had
prompted
Len
to
do
what
he
had
said
he
would
n't
do
again
,
and
that
was
to
try
and
persuade
him
to
accompany
him
home
.
Hitching
himself
over
to
sit
beside
Joe
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
,
Len
now
persisted
,
"
You
must
have
some
place
,
you
know
.
"
And
after
a
pause
,
he
went
on
,
"
I
sometimes
think
you
've
got
something
on
your
mind
,
Joe
.
If
it
would
help
any
,
I
'm
a
good
listener
.
I
knew
I
'm
a
good
chatterer
"
-
he
grinned
-
"
but
I
can
keep
my
own
counsel
,
and
yours
an'
all
,
if
you
want
to
talk
.
"
Joe
turned
and
looked
into
the
kindly
face
as
he
said
,
"
I
really
have
n't
any
family

Len
.
The
only
relative
I
now
have

well
,
I
became
estranged
from
her
.
"
With
his
head
to
one
side
Len
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
,
then
asked
,
"
No
friends
or
acquaintances

"
"
Oh

"
"
Er

yes
,
mainly
in
the
Navy
.
"

was
a
good
place

n't

were
docking
these
days
.
"

n't

"
Len
now
swung
his
head
to
the
side
.
"

'm

but

He
laughed
now
.
Then
assuming
the
voice
of
a
certain
discip
.
WO
that
neither
of
them
liked
,
he
clicked
his
heels
together
,
gave
an
imitation
of
a
salute
and
said
,
"

was
thumping
him
on
the
arm
now
with
his
fist

Joe
got
to
his
feet
and
cast
a
disparaging
glance
down
towards
Len
as
he
said
,

He
bent
down
towards
Len
now
and
pulled
a
face
at
him
.
"

Len
now
rose
from
the
bed
and
began
his
packing
,
while
Joe
,
picking
up
his
cap
,
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
,
then
said
,
"
Well

Joe
walked
down
the
length
of
the
hut
,
between
the
beds
,
where
here
and
there
men
were
sprucing
up
ready
to
grab
a
few
hours
"
freedom
away
from
the
camp
.
With
the
exception
of
two
others
and
himself
,
all
the
men
in
this
section
were
married
.
It
was
odd
when
he
came
to
think
about
it
,
but
every
now
and
again
one
or
two
of
them
would
be
posted
,
yet
the
five
men
who
had
accompanied
him
from
Cranwell
,
and
whose
beds
were
at
the
far
end
of
the
hut
,
were
still
here
.
Jack
Bisley
,
Sam
Temple
,
Amos
Bernstein
,
Angus
McBride
and
,
of
course
,
Len
.
Even
Warrant-Officer
Gilbert
,
who
had
arrived
just
a
week
before
them
,
was
still
here
.
Sometimes
he
longed
for
a
posting
just
to
see
different
surroundings
.
He
was
n't
so
much
concerned
about
the
men
or
this
particular
job
,
because
his
work
as
a
corporal
instructor
was
to
teach
his
squads
the
theory
and
practice
of
wireless
communication
,
and
especially
the
operation
of
the
transmitters
and
receivers
used
in
aircraft
.
No
,
it
was
n't
this
that
got
on
his
nerves
,
but
the
monotony
of
his
surrounding
,
the
long
,
long
road
through
the
camp
,
the
huts
going
off
here
and
there
,
the
airfield
dotted
with
little
planes
,
looking
like
toys
,
the
new
hall
that
was
used
for
entertainments
,
pictures
and
the
church
services
,
standing
out
like
a
sore
thumb
.
He
turned
up
a
side
path
to
go
into
the
NAAFI
.
There
were
very
few
people
in
the
building
and
no
one
at
the
counter
.
The
little
dumpy
girl
was
one
of
two
serving
.
He
was
glad
to
know
that
the
tall
languorous
one
was
n't
about
.
"
A
cup
of
tea
,
please

"
She
poured
out
the
tea
,
and
as
she
pushed
it
across
the
counter
to
him
he
handed
her
the
penny
.
Then
she
spoke
,
"
You
must
be
enjoying
this
war
,
"
she
said
.
"
What
?
"
He
put
his
head
forward
as
if
he
had
n't
heard
her
clearly
.
He
had
heard
her
but
he
did
n't
understand
what
she
meant
.
And
she
repeated
,
"
I
said
,
you
must
be
enjoying
this
war
.
"
"
What
makes
you
think
that
?
"
"
Well
,
you
never
seem
to
be
dashing
off
here
,
there
and
everywhere
like
the
rest
.
I
've
got
the
idea
you
've
fallen
in
love
with
the
camp
.
"
He
smiled
at
her
now
as
he
said
,
"
Yes
,
you
're
right
,
I
do
love
it
.
"
"
Aha
!
Aha
!
I
thought
you
did
.
"
She
took
a
cloth
and
wiped
down
the
counter
.
"
And
you
always
look
so
happy
.
"
He
closed
his
mouth
and
ran
his
tongue
round
the
inside
of
his
lips
.
She
was
pulling
his
leg
.
She
always
gave
as
much
as
she
got
,
more
,
he
should
say
.
She
was
always
quick
on
the
uptake
but
she
had
never
got
at
him
before
.
"
Brought
up
in
Barnardo
's
were
you
.
Like
the
feeling
of
a
large
family
?
"
"
Yes
"
-
his
face
wore
a
serious
expression
-
"
I
was
left
on
the
doorstep
in
the
proverbial
washbasket
.
"
"
The
what
?
"
She
seemed
to
be
straining
her
head
and
shoulders
over
the
counter
,
and
he
repeated
,
slowly
and
emphatically
,
"
The
proverbial
washbasket
;
you
know
.
"
"
Oh
.
"
She
nodded
.
"
Oh
,
yes
,
the
proverbial
wash
basket
.
Well
,
is
n't
that
funny
,
the
same
thing
happened
to
me
.
But
it
was
n't
the
proverbial
basket
,
it
was
just
an
ordinary
laundry
one
.
"
Suddenly
they
laughed
together
,
and
he
looked
at
her
,
really
looked
at
her
,
for
the
first
time
,
and
he
saw
that
she
had
a
lovely
set
of
teeth
.
All
her
good
points
seemed
to
be
in
her
mouth
,
her
voice
,
her
singing
and
her
quick
wit
,
and
he
noticed
,
too
,
something
different
about
her
:
she
'd
had
her
hair
waved
.
Previously
she
had
worn
it
flat
,
practically
plastered
down
on
her
head
,
until
it
looked
as
if
it
was
almost
painted
on
her
scalp
,
like
that
of
a
wooden
doll
.
Her
cap
was
set
well
back
on
her
hair
today
too
.
For
a
moment
he
wondered
about
her
,
what
she
thought
of
all
the
ribbing
and
chipping
that
she
received
almost
every
day
in
this
place
.
The
fellows
never
seemed
to
rib
the
other
NAAFI
girls
very
much
:
they
joked
with
them
,
but
not
in
the
same
way
as
they
did
with
Lemon
.
And
the
answer
came
:
she
was
like
a
break
in
the
monotony
,
like
a
resident
jester
.
At
one
time
jesters
were
picked
for
their
hunchbacks
,
or
some
deformity
.
But
she
was
n't
deformed
,
only
dumpy
.
It
was
a
shame
,
really
,
that
she
should
be
used
as
a
butt
,
yet
she
did
n't
seem
to
mind
;
in
fact
,
he
thought
she
enjoyed
it
.
And
anyway
,
what
was
there
for
a
girl
like
her
?
In
civvy
street
she
would
have
found
it
hard
to
find
a
fellow
to
chat
with
and
so
she
likely
considered
the
war
a
godsend
.
He
showed
his
surprise
on
his
face
now
as
she
leaned
still
further
over
the
counter
and
whispered
,
"
The
sleeping
beauty
's
at
a
loose
end
:
she
's
off
from
three
.
"
She
nodded
towards
the
door
behind
her
.
For
a
moment
he
was
taken
aback
as
he
realised
she
was
so
sorry
for
him
she
was
arranging
a
date
.
He
leaned
towards
her
and
in
a
whisper
he
said
,
"
I
do
n't
think
I
'll
waken
her
.
"
She
held
his
gaze
for
a
moment
;
.
then
,
her
lips
pressed
tight
,
she
made
a
small
laughing
sound
before
saying
,
"
Not
your
type
?
"
"
Not
really
-
too
thin
.
"
It
was
a
backhanded
compliment
,
the
best
he
could
do
,
and
he
straightened
up
and
nodded
to
her
before
taking
his
cup
from
the
counter
and
making
his
way
towards
an
empty
table
.
He
did
not
take
long
in
drinking
his
tea
but
by
the
time
he
had
finished
it
,
he
saw
that
she
was
no
longer
at
the
counter
,
her
place
having
been
taken
by
another
girl
.
He
went
out
thinking
that
,
behind
all
her
brusque
banter
,
she
was
a
kindly
little
soul
.
She
seemed
a
thoughtful
person
,
someone
of
like
nature
to
Mary
Smith
,
but
with
much
more
up
top
.
Oh
yes
,
Lemon
had
quite
a
bit
up
top
,
he
should
imagine
,
and
all
concealed
under
the
cap
and
bells
.
He
cycled
out
of
3-Wing
on
to
the
Hay-on-Wye
road
that
ran
through
the
camp
.
He
passed
the
technical
section
and
2-Wing
,
both
looking
oddly
deserted
,
except
for
a
figure
here
and
there
moving
between
the
nissen
huts
and
the
NAAFI
or
the
discip.
buildings
.
By
the
time
he
reached
Tyberton
,
which
was
only
three
miles
from
the
camp
,
he
was
sweating
,
for
the
sun
was
shining
fiercely
out
of
a
clear
sky
.
It
was
near
the
end
of
August
,
and
for
the
last
few
days
it
had
been
like
high
summer
.
He
had
reached
Blakemere
,
which
was
only
two
miles
further
on
,
when
he
pondered
if
he
should
take
another
direction
and
make
his
way
to
the
river
,
but
the
thought
that
even
this
far
out
there
'd
be
a
number
of
people
on
the
banks
today
,
mostly
youngsters
,
he
guessed
,
swimming
or
playing
the
usual
dangerous
game
of
swinging
out
over
the
river
on
a
rope
attached
to
a
tree
branch
,
deterred
him
.
He
was
n't
very
fond
of
the
river
Wye
,
for
its
rocky
crevasses
had
claimed
too
many
young
lives
even
during
the
short
time
he
had
been
there
.
Thinking
of
young
lives
,
his
mind
jumped
back
to
yesterday
,
when
he
had
heard
about
young
Harrington
.
He
had
been
a
recruit
in
his
class
,
a
bright
young
lad
.
He
knew
now
that
he
himself
would
never
have
made
a
flyer
.
Regulations
said
that
instructors
must
go
up
periodically
,
but
he
was
always
glad
when
they
touched
down
.
And
he
was
n't
alone
amongst
the
instructors
who
felt
this
way
:
Jack
Bisley
,
Sam
Temple
,
and
Amos
Bernstein
,
they
all
admitted
that
they
hated
it
;
but
Angus
McBride
and
Len
looked
forward
to
their
trips
as
if
they
were
half-day
school
holidays
.
It
had
come
to
him
over
the
last
year
or
so
that
there
was
only
one
thing
that
made
him
different
from
other
men
,
and
that
was
the
weight
he
was
carrying
on
his
mind
.
It
deadened
his
days
and
brought
him
upright
in
the
night
,
running
with
sweat
and
fear
,
his
arms
held
out
clutching
the
gun
with
which
he
had
just
shot
his
mother
.
When
he
set
out
today
it
had
been
his
intention
to
make
for
the
hills
bordering
the
Golden
Valley
,
but
when
he
got
through
Blakemere
the
sweat
was
dripping
from
his
chin
and
the
sight
of
a
stream
tinkling
its
way
not
three
yards
from
the
road
automatically
brought
his
legs
off
the
pedals
.
He
had
n't
noticed
it
before
because
of
the
hedge
growing
along
the
side
of
the
bank
,
but
here
,
and
for
some
way
ahead
,
it
was
open
to
the
road
.
He
laid
his
bike
on
the
grass
verge
and
went
down
to
the
water
's
edge
.
Kneeling
down
,
he
bent
over
and
sluiced
his
face
with
handfuls
of
the
surprisingly
cold
water
.
He
did
not
immediately
dry
his
face
but
knelt
over
the
stream
,
looking
down
to
where
the
sun
was
glinting
on
the
pebbles
,
turning
them
momentarily
into
stars
.
His
mind
became
still
.
This
was
the
kind
of
moment
when
words
formed
into
meanings
and
,
when
you
transferred
them
to
paper
,
they
turned
into
poetry
.
He
had
n't
put
pen
to
paper
since
the
day
before
Martin
died
,
and
he
doubted
if
he
would
ever
do
so
again
.
But
this
was
the
moment
when
it
should
happen
.
As
he
continued
to
gaze
down
into
the
sunlit
water
a
sound
intruded
into
his
mind
.
If
he
had
been
alert
to
everyday
things
he
knew
he
would
have
heard
it
sooner
.
He
lifted
one
knee
from
the
ground
and
turned
his
head
slowly
and
looked
up
the
slight
incline
to
the
path
,
and
in
his
sun-blinded
vision
he
saw
a
shape
.
It
was
a
small
broad
shape
dressed
in
blue
and
the
face
was
topped
by
a
straw
hat
.
He
had
the
vague
impression
that
the
face
was
of
an
oriental
and
was
beautiful
in
a
strange
way
.
As
he
took
his
handkerchief
out
and
wiped
away
the
water
that
was
still
dripping
from
the
front
of
his
hair
,
a
voice
said
,
"
I
would
n't
drink
that
if
I
were
you
;
the
cows
wash
in
it
just
round
the
corner
.
"
He
twisted
himself
to
his
feet
and
looked
in
amazement
at
the
girl
standing
above
him
.
He
had
recognized
the
voice
and
he
had
her
in
focus
now
.
She
was
wearing
a
slack
blue
dress
and
a
straw
hat
pushed
to
the
back
of
her
head
.
"
Oh
!
Hello
,
there
.
"
He
sounded
embarrassed
,
as
though
he
had
been
caught
in
some
misdemeanour
.
Having
climbed
the
bank
he
looked
down
on
her
and
smiled
as
he
said
,
"
I
did
n't
recognise
you
in
civvies
.
Well
,
they
make
a
difference
-
"
"
Partly
.
"
He
stared
at
her
.
What
could
one
say
to
that
?
It
was
her
habit
of
disparaging
herself
.
"
I
've
never
seen
you
along
this
way
before
,
"
she
said
.
"
I
've
never
been
this
way
before
.
I
was
making
for
the
hills
,
and
hoping
to
come
back
through
Peterchurch
.
"
"
Well
,
you
're
on
the
right
road
,
but
I
would
say
you
had
chosen
the
wrong
day
.
"
"
Yes
,
I
've
been
thinking
that
myself
.
"
He
was
smiling
at
her
again
.
Then
looking
around
,
he
said
,
"
Are
you
out
walking
?
"
"
Well
,
you
could
say
that
-
compulsory
walking
,
I
'm
looking
for
Simon
,
our
dog
.
He
's
gone
out
on
the
razzle
again
.
"
"
Is
he
a
labrador
,
a
yellow
one
?
"
"
Yes
,
that
's
him
.
Have
you
seen
him
?
"
"
I
passed
one
just
as
I
was
coming
out
of
Blakemere
.
"
"
Oh
,
that
's
where
he
's
got
to
.
Oh
well
,
I
need
n't
trouble
:
he
'll
be
back
.
He
's
got
a
lady
friend
down
there
.
"
"
Do
you
live
near
here
?
"
There
was
a
surprised
note
in
his
voice
.
"
Yes
,
over
there
.
"
She
pointed
into
the
distance
,
and
when
he
said
,
"
I
never
knew
,
"
she
answered
on
a
small
laugh
,
"
Well
,
why
should
you
?
"
Yes
,
why
should
he
?
It
was
a
silly
thing
to
say
.
He
felt
a
heat
rising
to
his
face
that
was
n't
caused
by
the
sun
.
He
was
always
awkward
in
women
's
company
,
girls
'
company
.
There
had
only
ever
been
one
with
whom
he
had
been
at
ease
.
He
did
n't
think
of
her
as
often
now
,
except
perhaps
on
a
long
weekend
when
he
was
off-duty
;
the
rest
of
the
time
he
had
things
to
occupy
his
mind
.
"
What
?
"
he
asked
.
"
I
said
,
could
you
do
with
a
cup
of
tea
?
"
He
hesitated
just
a
fraction
of
a
second
before
saying
,
"
Well
-
well
,
yes
.
Thank
you
.
"
And
he
immediately
told
himself
there
was
no
compromise
in
accepting
a
cup
of
tea
;
RAF
men
were
invited
into
all
kinds
of
homes
in
the
district
.
She
was
walking
on
ahead
up
the
narrow
path
now
,
he
following
behind
pushing
his
bike
,
when
he
said
,
"
Your
people
live
here
?
"
"
An
aunt
.
She
has
a
cottage
.
"
The
word
cottage
conjured
up
in
his
mind
the
Smiths
'
dwelling
;
but
a
few
minutes
later
,
when
he
saw
what
she
had
called
a
cottage
,
he
realised
it
was
far
removed
from
the
Smiths
'
dwelling
as
Screehaugh
had
been
,
in
that
it
was
a
substantially
built
house
.
Its
side
wall
was
covered
with
the
dead
fronds
of
a
massive
wisteria
;
the
front
showed
six
large
windows
,
and
the
front
door
appeared
to
be
at
the
end
of
the
house
.
The
roughly
cut
lawn
led
right
to
the
stone
doorstep
and
was
bordered
by
a
flower
garden
at
one
side
and
a
summer
house
at
the
other
,
beyond
which
was
a
yard
showing
some
outhouses
.
The
door
of
the
house
was
open
.
He
paused
in
the
doorway
and
watched
her
go
into
a
dim
hall
,
calling
,
"
Hoo-hoo
!
Where
are
you
?
"
The
voice
that
came
back
to
him
was
unlike
hers
in
tone
but
matched
it
in
substance
,
"
Where
do
you
think
I
am
?
Up
the
pole
?
"
She
turned
to
him
,
smiling
widely
now
,
and
beckoned
him
into
the
hall
.
It
was
quite
a
large
area
for
this
type
of
house
,
being
all
,
he
imagined
,
of
sixteen
feet
square
.
He
noticed
,
too
,
that
it
was
stone
floored
,
and
immediately
he
took
in
the
feeling
of
clinical
cleanliness
.
"
I
've
brought
a
visitor
.
"
He
did
n't
move
from
the
middle
of
the
hall
,
but
watched
Maggie
standing
in
a
doorway
to
the
right
,
and
she
turned
her
face
to
him
,
laughing
now
as
the
voice
from
the
other
room
came
to
him
,
saying
,
"
Male
or
female
?
"
"
Male

"
"
Thank
God
for
that
!

n't

"
Maggie
now
beckoned
him
towards
her
,
and
some
what
reluctantly
he
followed
her
along
a
short
passage
and
into
a
long
sun-lit
kitchen
,
where
a
woman
was
standing
at
a
wooden
table
mixing
some
ingredients
in
a
bowl
.
On
the
sight
of
him
she
stopped
immediately
.
Her
mouth
opened
and
shut
;
then
looking
at
Maggie
she
said
,
"
You
silly
daft
lump
,
I
thought
you
were
joking
and
it
was
Simon

brought
back

"
"

"
She
turned
and
looked
up
at
Joe
,
and
he
,
smiling
now
,
said
,
"
I
'm
always
willing

"

It
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
his
name
pronounced
correctly
since
coming
into
the
camp
.
He
was
generally
called
Jabbie
or
Joe-boy
.
"

'm

He
was
shaking
hands
now
with
the
woman
,
who
was
the
exact
antithesis
of
her
niece
,
being
thin
and
bony
;
even
her
arms
,
showing
bare
where
she
had
her
sleeves
rolled
up
almost
to
the
armpits
,
looked
fleshless
.
"
How
do
you
do
?
"
"
I
do
nicely

you

bet

-
she
waved
them
both
away
-
"

yourselves
into
the
sitting-room
,
out
of
this
.
"
He
found
himself
smiling
widely
as
he
went
to
obey
her
and
for
a
moment
he
felt
he
had
dropped
into
a
home
which
was
familiar
to
him
.
Then
Maggie
's
fingers
touching
his
sleeve
lightly
stopped
his
departure
as
she
said
,
"
Do
n't
take
any
notice
of
her
,
sit
yourself
down
there
.
"
She
pointed
to
a
high-backed
wooden
chair
,
adding
,
"
If
she
makes
you
sitting-room
company
she
cuts
your
rations
.
"
He
hesitated
for
a
moment
as
to
what
to
do
;
then
looking
again
at
the
woman
at
the
table
,
who
was
now
smiling
at
him
,
he
sat
down
in
the
chair
,
and
for
the
next
ten
minutes
he
listened
to
the
banter
between
the
two
of
them
.
There
was
no
pause
between
exchanges
;
all
the
while
their
tongues
wagged
their
hands
worked
,
for
the
woman
at
the
table
went
on
making
her
cakes
,
while
Maggie
walked
back
and
forth
into
and
out
of
what
he
took
to
be
a
pantry
at
the
far
end
of
the
kitchen
,
bringing
out
all
that
was
necessary
for
a
tea
.
She
looked
so
different
in
the
blue
dress
;
still
fat
,
but
more
like
a
schoolgirl
might
do
,
and
she
seemed
as
light
on
her
feet
as
a
dancer
.
There
were
things
he
consciously
noticed
about
people
which
he
brought
to
mind
long
after
he
had
ceased
to
watch
them
,
but
now
he
noted
for
the
first
time
that
she
had
very
small
feet
-
they
could
have
belonged
to
the
oriental
he
had
imagined
her
to
be
through
the
sun
haze
.
Also
,
strangely
,
he
noted
there
was
a
similarity
in
the
faces
of
the
aunt
and
niece
.
Yet
their
features
were
as
different
as
chalk
from
cheese
.
The
woman
at
the
table
had
,
he
should
imagine
,
once
been
quite
good-looking
,
even
beautiful
,
whereas
no
one
,
not
even
with
the
kindest
instincts
,
could
attribute
any
beauty
to
Maggie
's
features
.
Yet
looking
from
one
to
the
other
,
he
now
realised
where
the
similarity
lay
:
it
was
in
the
eyes
.
But
where
the
older
woman
's
eyes
lay
in
elongated
hollows
,
the
younger
one
's
were
round
,
lying
almost
flush
with
the
unlined
skin
.
Again
he
had
the
impression
that
she
was
a
young
girl
,
for
there
was
a
smoothness
about
her
skin
that
one
sees
in
the
young
before
the
face
reaches
the
border
of
adulthood
.
Yet
why
,
with
such
skin
,
such
eyes
,
and
that
good
mouthful
of
teeth
,
did
she
still
appear
so
very
plain
?
What
constituted
beauty
?
The
bone
formation
,
how
each
feature
was
set
?
He
did
n't
know
.
All
he
did
know
at
this
moment
was
that
it
seemed
a
shame
a
girl
such
as
Maggie
here
,
with
brains
,
because
she
was
no
fool
,
and
a
talent
such
as
she
had
,
should
be
encased
in
a
body
that
held
no
appeal
.
"
Where
are
you
from
?
"
Maggie
's
Aunt
Lizzie
was
asking
.
"
What

"
"
It
's
the
heat

nearly
asleep

He
took
the
tray
from
Maggie
,
and
she
,
picking
up
two
plates
from
the
table
,
said
,
"

They
passed
through

hall
again

then
he
followed
her
across
the
lawn
to
where
a
rough
wooden
table
was
placed
near
the
trunk
of
a
large
oak
tree
,
to
which
was
nailed
an
equally
rough
seat

Maggie
took
the
things
from
the
tray
and
set
them
on
the
table
she
said

now
paused

stared
up
at

quietly

sat
down

up

do
with
it

And
as
she
sat
down
she
added
,

she
now
wagged
her
finger
in
Joe
's
direction
-
"

The
finger
was
now
pointing
at
Maggie
.

butter

stuff
from
the
farms

everybody
has
n't
got

could
take
you

up

I
'm
speaking
the
truth

The
fiddling

down

"
Maggie
was
stabbing
her
finger
at
the
different
plates
on
the
table
,
and
her
aunt
wagged
her
head
and
pursed
her
lips
before
she
said
,
flatly
,
"

'm
courting

the
airmen

She
jerked
her
head
backwards
,
and
on
this
both
Joe
and
Maggie
burst
out
laughing
.
"
Think
I
'm
past
it

"
She
poked
her
head
now
towards
Joe
,
and
gallantly
he
now
replied
,
"

could
never

past

Mrs
Robson

"

a

me
day

you
know
that
?
Could
take
me
pick
,
and
I
did
.
Oh
"
-
she
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
-
"
I
wish
I
had
me
life
over
again
.
Yet
"
-
her
voice
became
serious
-
"
I
would
n't
want
it
to
end
anywhere
else
but
here
"
-
she
now
looked
about
her
-
"
with
the
hills
behind
me
and
the
river
at
me
feet
,
so
to
speak
.
"
During
the
silence
that
followed
Joe
experienced
the
most
odd
feeling
,
for
he
had
the
desire
to
reach
out
across
the
table
and
to
take
her
hand
:
not
Maggie
's
,
but
this
woman
's
,
the
hand
of
this
woman
who
would
never
see
sixty
again
.
Then
he
saw
her
face
change
and
there
was
his
mother
staring
at
him
,
and
as
if
his
hand
had
already
been
extended
he
felt
himself
jerking
it
back
.
So
real
was
the
sensation
that
his
fingers
slipped
on
the
handle
of
the
tea
cup
and
when
the
tea
spilt
into
the
saucer
he
exclaimed
,
"
Oh
!
Oh
,
I
'm
sorry
!
"
Then
on
an
embarrassed
laugh
,
he
added
,
"
I
'm
not
used
to
polite
society
.
"
"
Well
,
we
're
not
polite
society

lad
,
so
tip
it
on
to
the
grass
and
we
'll
pretend
we
're
not
locking

And
we
could
do
with
some
hot
water
.
Will
you
get
some
,
Maggie
?
"
Maggie
had
n't
reached
the
house
door
before
Mrs
Robson
asked
,
"

"

Again
he
paused
;
then
lifting
the
cup
,
he
almost
gulped
at
the
tea
before
saying
,
No
,
they
are
both
-
dead
.
"
He
became
embarrassed
when
he
found
the
woman
's
eyes
tight
on
him
.
Then
she
was
smiling
,
saying
,
"
Funny
how
I
always
run
into
orphans

n't
it

"
What
did
the
question
infer
?
He
did
n't
know
,
and
he
almost
stammered
as
he
replied
,
"

really

see
her
in
the
Naafi

a
lot

first
acquaintance
with

heard
her
sing

voice

"

Again
he
was
forced
to
pause
.
"
Yes
,
I
-
I
think
it
should
.
"
"
She
's
a
clever
lass

does
n't
only
sing

she
plays
the
piano

composes
a
bit
an'
all
.
"
"
Really

"
"
Yes
.
"
And
without
any
lead-up
she
said
,
"
From
what
I
gather
some
people
take
the
mickey
out
of
her
down
there
because

her
name

punning
it
like

and
she

a
bit
fat

She
did
n't
tell
me
,

I
heard

I
ever
heard
anybody
doing

buggers

"
The
word
was
said
with
such
vehemence
,
yet
at
the
same
time
sounded
so
funny
,
that
he
almost
laughed
.
Fortunately
he
did
n't
,
for
what
she
said
now
was
,
"
There
's
no
one
likes
a
laugh
more
than
I
do

there
's
a
time
and
a
place
for
everything
.
She
was
born
small
,
she
was
born
fat
,
and
there
's
no
denying
that
she
's
no
beauty
,
but
her
face
has
got
something
.
At
times
when
I
look
at
her
it
strikes
me
as
it
's
got
something
;
not
beauty
,
but
something
that
goes
beyond
it
.
And
she
's
worth
a
thousand
of
your
so-called
beauties
.
By
God
!
she
is
.
"
As
her
head
wagged
his
embarrassment
grew
;
then
in
a
low
tone
she
muttered
,
"
Here
she
comes

Now
mind
,
do
n't
say

ever
mentioned
this

"
No

"
I
thought
so

She
now
pushed
a
plate
of
scones
towards
Joe
,
and
he
,
taking
one
,
said
,
"

've
already

two

're
lovely

"
I
never
bake
anything

is
n't

"
She
now
laughed
as
she
added
,
"
And
should
you
make
a
habit
of
coming
here
you
'll
soon
learn

'm

very
modest
woman
;
hate
self-praise
.
"
As
he
joined
in
with
her
laughter
he
felt
a
qualm
of
uneasiness
as
to
what
ideas
she
was
getting
into
her
head
with
regard
to
his
visiting
in
the
future
.
My
!
that
would
be
something
to
cope
with
,
if
it
got
round
the
unit
that
he
was
going
up
to
Lemon
's
place
.
Of
all
the
girls
he
could
have
taken
up
with
in
the
camp
,
she
was
about
the
most
unlikely
.
When
the
tea
was
over
Maggie
brought
out
two
deck
chairs
from
the
summer
house
and
after
putting
them
up
she
pointed
to
one
,
saying
,
"
Make
yourself
comfortable

'm
going

Aunt

up

But
before

go
,
let's
get
things
straight
,
eh
?
"
Her
face
was
on
a
level
with
his
;
she
stared
at
him
for
some
seconds
before
she
said
quietly
,
"
You
need
n't
be
concerned

you
might
have
started
something

ideas
that
way

my
aunt
would
say
,
I
happen
to
be
a
sensible
lass

And
I
wo
n't
suggest
we
ride
back
into
camp
together
either

so
sit
yourself
down
there
and
relax

underneath
all
your
politeness

're
on
edge

"
He
knew
his
face
was
red
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
he
stammered
,
"
O-oh
now
,
now
please
.
"
He
put
out
his
hand
towards
her
,
but
she
waved
it
aside
with
a
flick
of
her
own
,
saying
,
"
Look
,
we
both
know
what
it
's
like
down
there

do
n't
we

So
let's
leave
it
at
that
,
shall
we
?
And
loosen
your
collar
and
tie
;
their
enough
sweat
on
it
to
wash
it
.
"
He
had
risen
and
now
stood
watching
her
go
towards
the
side
door
.
Such
bluntness
,
such
honesty
,
it
was
embarrassing
;
you
were
n't
prepared
for
it
,
so
you
did
n't
know
how
to
react
.
He
wished
-
he
wished
he
liked
her
.
Oh
well
!
He
jerked
his
head
at
himself
.
He
liked
her
,
you
could
n't
help
but
like
her
,
but
he
wished
in
this
moment
it
was
in
him
to
more
than
like
her
.
He
wished
he
was
big
enough
to
forget
that
she
was
a
fat
young
woman
with
nothing
about
her
but
her
voice
.
He
sat
down
in
the
deck
chair
,
loosened
his
collar
and
tie
,
then
lay
back
and
looked
up
into
the
dark
coolness
of
the
oak
branches
.
For
a
moment
he
imagined
he
was
in
another
world
,
a
simple
uncomplicated
world
:
a
world
where
there
was
no
place
down
below
in
the
valley
where
men
were
being
prepared
for
war
;
that
there
was
no
place
in
Northumberland
where
a
woman
sat
in
a
room
all
day
with
only
her
thoughts
for
company
;
that
there
was
no
one
called
Carrie
Smith
;
that
the
world
had
dwindled
and
there
was
only
this
secluded
garden
and
a
secluded
house
,
as
had
been
said
,
with
the
hills
to
the
back
of
it
and
the
river
at
its
feet
and
two
women
so
unalike
,
yet
alike
:
so
understanding
,
so
thoughtful
of
each
other
,
and
not
only
of
each
other
,
but
of
him
.
His
head
fell
to
the
side
;
his
cheek
to
the
canvas
of
the
deck
chair
,
and
his
feet
slowly
slipped
forward
as
he
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
.
He
was
aware
of
being
awake
long
before
he
opened
his
eyes
.
At
first
he
felt
more
relaxed
than
he
had
done
for
a
long
time
.
In
fact
,
he
could
n't
remember
ever
feeling
like
this
.
He
lay
in
a
sort
of
mental
haze
until
a
feeling
of
restriction
just
below
his
buttocks
penetrated
his
still
slumbering
state
.
The
pain
increased
and
when
he
attempted
to
move
his
legs
the
right
one
went
into
an
agonising
cramp
that
caused
his
eyes
and
mouth
to
open
simultaneously
.
He
pulled
himself
into
a
sitting
position
on
the
chair
and
began
to
rub
his
calf
vigorously
.
Then
,
his
head
bent
forward
,
he
noticed
that
the
shadows
were
long
on
the
grass
;
in
fact
,
there
was
but
merely
a
streak
of
sunshine
bordering
the
flower
garden
now
.
He
reached
out
for
his
tie
that
was
on
the
table
.
He
did
n't
remember
putting
it
there
.
He
was
on
his
feet
now
,
turning
up
his
collar
,
pulling
the
tie
around
his
neck
the
while
he
looked
towards
the
house
.
He
was
about
to
move
towards
the
back
door
when
Mrs
Robson
appeared
.
As
she
made
her
way
slowly
towards
him
she
said
,
"
You
're
awake
then
.
If
you
had
been
dead
drunk
,
you
could
n't
have
slept
deeper
.
Feel
better
?
"
"
I
feel
fine
,
but
I
'm
very
sorry
.
I
-
I
never
meant
to
fall
asleep
.
It
-
it
must
have
been
the
heat
.
What
time
is
it
?
Oh
!
"
He
gave
an
embarrassed
laugh
,
then
looked
at
his
wrist-watch
,

Maggie

of

's

she
's
stationed
so
close

a

He
smiled
at
her
,
then
went
into
the
house
.
Five
minutes
later
,
when
he
returned
to
the
lawn
,
she
was
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
tree
and
,
standing
before
her
,
he
said
,

His
smile
broadened
as
he
said
,
"

His
face
was
straight
as
,
staring
back
at
her
,
he
said
,
seriously
,
almost
stiffly
,
now
,
"

She
did
not
immediately
reply
;
her
eyes
narrowed
and
her
eyelids
blinked
a
number
of
times
before
she
said
,

she
jerked
her
head
to
the
side
-
"

upon
this
war

silly

keep
saying

clever

song
around
them

He
half
turned

had

walking
away

the
path
that
led
to
the

she
turned
her
head
and
said
,

He
stood
still
as
he
recalled
her
plain
speaking
,
and
,
his
head
hanging
,
he
experienced
a
mixture
of
relief
and
a
feeling
that
was
most
akin
to
shame
.
But
there
was
no
getting
away
from
it
;
the
overwhelming
feeling
was
one
of
relief
,
because
if
they
had
ridden
in
together
they
would
undoubtedly
have
been
spotted

Her
voice
had
a
sad
note
to
it
and
he
knew
that
she
was
standing
at
the
gate
watching
him
as
he
rode
away
.
He
again
knew
what
it
was
to
feel
embarrassed
when
,
on
the
Monday
dinner
time
,
he
went
into
the
NAAM
,
and
looking
at
her
over
the
counter
,
he
said
,
"

she
answered
,

He
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
before
saying
,
"

"
As
she
turned
away
,
Rona
,
who
had
just
finished
serving
,
came
and
stood
in
front
of
him
.
Her
eyelashes
fluttering
,
she
said
softly
,
"
Had
a
nice
weekend
?
"
For
a
moment
he
thought
there
was
a
double
meaning
in
her
words
,
but
he
dismissed
the
thought
when
he
recognised
it
was
one
of
her
usual
openings
to
draw
him
into
conversation
.
But
he
answered
her
pleasantly
,
saying
,
"
Very
nice

exceptionally
nice

"
"
Lucky
you

He
watched
Maggie
bump
the
tall
girl
with
her
hip
,
then
add
,
"
There
's
a
gang
of
parched
Arabs
coming
in
from
the
desert
;
see
to
them
.
"
For
the
first
time
in
what
seemed
an
age
to
him
,
he
wanted
not
only
to
laugh
but
to
guffaw
,
like
he
used
to
do
when
Harry
or
Martin
came
out
with
something
funny
.
At
the
same
time
he
realised
that
there
was
some
form
of
seniority
behind
the
counter
,
and
that
Maggie
was
in
charge
.
Just
as
he
had
been
wont
to
do
as
a
boy
,
so
this
morning
after
waking
,
he
had
lain
and
thought
of
the
day
ahead
and
what
he
had
to
do
in
it
,
and
he
was
aware
that
life
had
taken
on
a
tinge
of
colour
.
The
feeling
was
still
with
him
,
and
it
was
n't
unpleasant
.
"
Thanks
,
Maggie
.
"
He
took
the
tea
from
her
,
put
a
coin
on
the
counter
and
smiled
at
her
,
then
turned
away
.
Some
minutes
later
,
the
rush
having
subsided
,
Rona
,
bending
down
to
Maggie
,
said
,
"
Since
when
has
that
one
called
you
Maggie
?
He
hardly
opens
his
mouth
.
I
think
he
's
got
ideas
about
himself
.
"
"
Oh
.
"
Maggie
took
up
the
cloth
and
began
to
wipe
a
section
of
the
counter
.
Her
head
on
one
side
,
she
bit
on
her
lip
,
looked
up
at
the
waiting
face
above
her
,
then
said
in
a
not
too
certain
tone
,
"
Eeh
,
let
me
think
.
It
must
be
since
we
were
first
married
.
"
Betty
Allsop
,
who
had
overheard
the
exchange
,
let
out
a
hoot
of
laughter
,
while
Maggie
went
on
rubbing
at
the
counter
,
but
Rona
's
reply
was
,
"
That
'll
be
the
day
,
even
with
a
fellow
like
Billings
.
"
Still
rubbing
away
at
the
counter
,
Maggie
had
to
resist
the
desire
to
turn
round
and
bring
the
wet
cloth
across
the
beautiful
face
to
the
side
of
her
.
Yet
,
at
the
same
time
she
knew
she
had
laid
herself
open
for
such
a
reply
.
She
drew
in
a
deep
breath
;
then
,
the
cloth
still
in
her
hand
,
she
turned
about
and
went
into
the
kitchen
.
And
there
she
wrung
the
cloth
out
in
the
sink
.
Then
still
holding
it
,
she
went
to
the
toilet
and
,
just
as
she
was
,
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
and
,
bending
forward
,
she
went
through
the
motion
of
wringing
out
the
cloth
once
again
.
Presently
,
her
teeth
pressed
tightly
down
on
her
lip
,
she
turned
her
head
and
leant
her
brow
against
the
stone
wall
.
As
Mrs
Robson
said
,
people
had
taken
to
war
like
they
did
to
life
:
they
had
accepted
it
and
were
living
with
it
and
with
all
the
things
it
did
to
them
;
but
why
did
them
up
top
have
to
go
and
stop
the
flower
trains
coming
from
Cornwall
?
There
was
nothing
like
a
flower
to
cheer
you
up
on
a
dark
day
.
It
was
to
save
transport
,
the
government
said
.
That
was
just
a
gimmick
,
like
when
they
stopped
the
holiday
trains
.
Yet
,
when
there
was
any
racing
on
,
transport
could
be
found
for
that
,
could
n't
it
?
And
who
went
to
the
racecourses
?
she
wanted
to
know
.
Aha
!
And
income
tax
eight
and
sixpence
in
the
pound
.
And
then
the
daft
things
they
were
up
to
:
ordering
booksellers
to
destroy
their
maps
,
and
ordinary
folk
an'
all
,
as
if
the
Germans
when
they
landed
would
n't
know
where
they
were
going
.
Men
,
really
!
It
was
women
they
wanted
up
there
to
spread
some
common
sense
among
them
.
Next
to
Churchill
there
was
only
one
man
whom
Mrs
Robson
apparently
favoured
,
and
that
was
Sir
Arthur
Harris
,
because
was
n't
he
sending
bombers
over
by
the
thousand
to
knock
hell
out
of
them
over
there
?
Giving
them
a
taste
of
the
Battle
of
Britain
,
hitting
their
churches
and
cathedrals
,
just
as
the
Jerries
had
done
here
.
Dealing
with
wireless
every
day
,
Joe
rarely
listened
when
off
duty
to
accounts
of
small
successes
put
over
in
the
announcer
's
authoritative
tone
and
the
defeats
intoned
as
if
reporting
a
death
:
which
it
was
,
though
not
a
single
death
,
such
as
when
Tobruk
had
fallen
in
June
and
Mussolini
went
into
Libya
.
Names
like
Rommel
,
Auchinleck
,
El
Alamein
sounded
as
common
to
the
ear
as
Smith
,
Jones
and
Robinson
;
yet
Joe
had
the
feeling
that
he
was
being
forced
to
stand
on
the
sidelines
and
watch
a
game
in
which
he
had
not
the
slightest
interest
.
Yet
he
knew
,
at
least
in
this
he
was
n't
alone
:
the
feeling
,
if
it
did
n't
pervade
the
camp
,
certainly
pervaded
his
section
.
This
part
of
the
country
did
n't
seem
to
be
in
the
war
.
The
munitions
factory
in
Hereford
seemed
to
be
the
only
concession
to
it
.
The
people
went
about
their
daily
work
in
an
ordinary
fashion
:
there
were
no
air
raids
,
no
scurrying
to
shelters
,
no
fire
engines
tearing
through
the
countryside
.
Naturally
,
most
of
the
staff
in
the
camp
considered
themselves
lucky
to
have
been
posted
here
and
dreaded
the
idea
of
a
move
,
which
created
the
feeling
of
being
on
the
sidelines
.
For
himself
,
he
would
n't
have
minded
a
posting
;
in
fact
,
he
would
have
welcomed
it
,
because
there
was
another
complication
entering
his
life
:
vague
,
but
nevertheless
there
.
Since
that
day
in
August
when
he
had
first
visited
the
house
up
the
valley
,
he
had
,
during
the
past
ten
weeks
,
made
a
dozen
return
visits
.
But
only
once
had
he
ridden
back
with
Maggie
.
And
then
it
was
dark
and
their
entry
into
camp
had
gone
unnoticed
.
But
it
was
n't
the
camp
reactions
he
was
troubled
about
at
the
moment
,
it
was
Mrs
Robson
's
.
He
liked
Mrs
Robson
,
he
had
become
very
fond
of
her
:
she
was
down
to
earth
,
and
she
seemed
to
bring
him
out
of
himself
,
but
she
seemed
to
be
harbouring
serious
ideas
about
Maggie
and
him
.
And
that
was
ridiculous
.
Maggie
herself
,
he
knew
,
understood
the
situation
well
enough
:
there
was
no
one
more
sensible
than
Maggie
;
but
her
auntie
,
who
seemed
to
have
taken
the
place
of
her
mother
and
,
like
a
mother
,
had
her
future
interests
at
heart
,
was
always
bringing
her
qualities
to
the
fore
for
him
to
admire
.
He
was
well
aware
of
Maggie
's
qualities
.
She
was
an
extraordinary
human
being
,
and
it
was
a
damn
shame
that
her
personality
and
talents
should
have
been
encased
in
that
little
dumpy
body
of
hers
.
Last
week
,
after
a
concert
,
he
had
listened
to
a
small
group
of
airmen
,
seated
at
a
table
next
to
his
,
discussing
her
.
One
had
said
,
"
Her
height
does
n't
matter
.
I
tell
you
,
if
she
was
out
in
Hollywood
they
would
send
her
to
one
of
those
beauty
farms
,
where
they
starve
them
and
batter
them
about
and
knock
them
into
shape
;
then
they
would
give
her
a
plastic
nose
,
or
make
the
one
she
's
got
more
pointed
,
put
false
eyelashes
on
her
,
give
her
hair
an
expert
cut
,
and
walla
!
she
'd
be
a
sensation
.
They
would
call
her
The
Little
Nightingale
.
"
There
had
been
laughter
and
one
of
the
men
had
said
,
"
But
you
're
not
far
wrong
.
"
"
No
,
"
the
former
speaker
had
replied
,
"
I
know
I
'm
not
,
because
you
do
n't
hear
a
voice
like
hers
every
day
.
And
she
's
got
it
up
top
,
an'
all
.
There
's
nobody
readier
with
her
tongue
than
our
Lemon
.
"
Another
voice
had
said
,
"
Then
why
do
n't
you
have
a
go
?
"
and
the
answer
had
been
a
bit
of
a
scuffle
and
more
laughter
.
And
now
here
,
this
very
minute
,
her
aunt
was
saying
almost
in
as
many
words
to
him
,
Why
do
n't
you
have
a
go
?
"
Marriage
is
a
funny
thing
,
Joe
.
I
know
what
I
'm
talking
about
.
I
've
had
three
goes
at
it
,
and
I
can
tell
you
that
looks
are
the
last
thing
to
be
considered
;
it
's
what
's
underneath
that
matters
in
the
long
run
.
I
married
me
first
for
looks
,
and
my
God
,
did
n't
I
pay
for
it
!
If
he
had
n't
had
the
business
I
would
have
left
him
within
a
month
.
Oh
,
I
'm
being
honest
.
"
She
nodded
her
head
at
him
from
where
she
sat
to
the
side
of
the
fireplace
in
the
sitting-room
.
"
Anyway
,
I
thought
I
was
entitled
to
my
share
of
what
he
had
,
for
from
the
time
I
'd
gone
there
five
years
before
,
I
'd
pulled
the
business
up
out
of
nothing
.
He
had
n't
as
much
in
his
head
,
that
one
,
as
an
addled
egg
.
His
dad
had
died
long
before
his
time
,
and
that
's
how
he
came
into
it
-
the
business
.
And
you
know
another
thing
,
Joe
?
Marriage
is
a
business
,
and
after
the
bed
business
is
over
you
've
often
got
twenty-three
hours
in
the
day
to
live
with
your
partner
;
especially
,
that
is
,
if
you
're
working
together
like
I
was
with
him
.
Me
second
one
was
n't
bad
;
he
had
a
business
head
on
him
.
It
was
when
I
married
him
that
we
bought
this
house
here
,
just
to
escape
to
at
the
weekends
,
you
know
.
But
me
third
was
the
best
of
the
bunch
.
He
had
a
face
on
him
like
a
battered
pluck
;
he
was
gangly
,
you
know
"
-
she
shook
her
arm
-
"
loose-limbed
;
but
he
was
the
kindest
,
most
considerate
man
you
could
ever
wish
to
meet
.
But
life
plays
you
dirty
tricks
.
I
'd
spent
most
of
it
with
the
other
two
,
one
bad
and
the
other
indifferent
,
now
I
'd
come
across
a
good
one
and
fate
gave
us
four
years
together
,
that
's
all
.
But
looking
back
I
think
of
them
as
compensation
for
the
rest
of
me
life
before
,
and
what
's
to
come
-
Maggie
's
a
fine
girl
,
Joe
;
she
's
one
in
a
thousand
.
"
"
I
know
that
,
Mrs
Robson
,
but
we
understand
each
other
.
"
"
Aye
-
"
she
rose
from
the
chair
,
went
to
a
basket
at
the
side
of
the
hearth
and
,
taking
up
a
log
,
she
almost
flung
it
on
the
fire
,
and
as
she
dusted
her
hands
she
ended
,
"
that
's
what
she
tells
me
.
Anyway
,
you
'll
say
it
's
none
of
my
business
,
but
I
can
tell
you
,
you
'll
go
further
and
fare
a
lot
worse
.
Aye
,
by
God
you
will
,
Joe
.
"
What
could
he
say
?
He
sat
,
his
head
bent
,
his
fingers
clasped
together
,
each
one-twitching
;
and
then
she
was
standing
in
front
of
him
,
apologetic
,
saying
,
"
I
've
gone
past
meself
,
Joe
,
I
'm
sorry
,
but
I
'm
concerned
for
her
.
She
's
like
a
daughter
,
the
daughter
I
never
had
,
and
I
lie
awake
at
nights
thinking
what
's
going
to
happen
to
her
when
I
'm
gone
,
because
men
being
what
they
are
,
they
'll
take
her
on
because
of
the
money
.
And
she
'll
get
all
I
have
,
which
is
n't
to
be
sneezed
at
.
"
He
looked
up
at
her
now
and
said
quietly
,
"
I
-
I
do
n't
think
you
need
worry
about
her
being
hoodwinked
by
anyone
;
she
can
see
through
most
people
.
"
"
Aye
,
Joe
,
I
know
that
.
There
's
nobody
more
sensible
,
but
underneath
all
the
sense
there
's
the
woman
,
and
her
needs
,
and
the
feeling
that
she
's
going
to
go
down
through
the
years
alone
.
It
's
a
comfort
,
you
know

-
she
smiled
now
-
"
to
think
that
there
's
somebody
opposite

the
first

She
now
moved
a
few
steps
backwards
and
sat
down
again
,
straightening
out
one
leg
and
rubbing
it
as
she
did
so
.
And
he
paused
a
moment
until
he
imagined
that
the
pain
of
her
rheumatics
had
eased
,
and
then
he
said
,
slowly
but
firmly
,
"

n't

out

else

serious

deeply

stared
at

she
sighed

said
,
