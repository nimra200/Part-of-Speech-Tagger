Evil
was
a
stupid
word
.
It
had
the
same
sort
of
sense
,
largely
meaningless
,
amorphous
,
diffuse
,
woolly
,
as
applied
to
"
love
"
.
Everyone
had
a
vague
idea
of
what
it
meant
but
none
could
precisely
have
defined
it
.
It
seemed
,
in
a
way
,
to
imply
something
supernatural
.
These
thoughts
had
been
inspired
in
her
husband
's
mind
by
a
sentence
from
a
review
on
the
cover
of
a
paperback
novel
Lili
Manjusri
had
bought
at
Salzburg
airport
.
"
A
brooding
cloud
of
evil
,
"
the
commentator
had
written
,
"
hovers
over
this
dark
and
magnificent
saga
from
the
first
page
to
the
astonishing
denouement
.
"
Lili
had
bought
it
because
it
was
the
only
work
in
English
she
could
find
at
the
bookstall
.
Whenever
Shiva
considered
the
word
he
saw
in
his
mind
's
eye
a
grinning
Mephistopheles
with
small
,
curly
ram
's
horns
,
capering
in
frock
coat
.
Events
in
his
own
past
he
never
thought
of
as
evil
but
rather
as
mistaken
,
immensely
regrettable
,
brought
about
by
fear
and
greed
.
Shiva
thought
most
of
the
folly
of
the
world
was
brought
about
by
fear
and
greed
and
to
call
this
evil
,
as
if
it
were
the
result
of
purposeful
calculation
and
deliberate
wrongdoing
,
was
to
show
ignorance
of
human
psychology
.
It
was
in
this
way
that
he
was
thinking
when
,
with
Lili
by
his
side
and
their
suitcases
on
a
trolley
he
would
abandon
at
the
tube-station
entrance
,
he
looked
up
and
met
the
eyes
of
Adam
Verne-Smith
.
Shiva
had
no
doubt
it
was
Adam
he
saw
.
To
him
Europeans
did
not
specially
all
look
alike
.
Adam
and
Rufus
Fletcher
,
for
instance
,
though
both
white
,
Caucasian
and
of
more
or
less
Anglo-Saxon-Celtic-Norse-Norman
ancestry
,
were
very
dissimilar
in
appearance
,
Adam
being
slight
and
white-skinned
with
a
lot
of
bushy
(
now
receding
)
dark
hair
,
while
Rufus
was
burly
and
fair
with
curiously
sharp
,
pointed
features
for
so
fleshy
a
man
.
Shiva
had
seen
Rufus
some
years
before
,
though
he
was
absolutely
certain
Rufus
had
either
not
seen
or
not
recognized
him
,
while
he
was
equally
sure
Adam
knew
perfectly
well
who
he
was
.
He
began
to
smile
from
exactly
the
motive
Adam
had
attributed
to
him
,
a
desire
to
ingratiate
and
to
defend
himself
,
to
turn
away
wrath
.
He
had
been
born
in
England
,
had
never
seen
India
,
spoke
English
as
his
cradle
tongue
and
had
forgotten
all
the
Hindi
he
had
ever
learned
but
he
had
all
the
immigrant
's
protective
reactions
and
all
his
self-consciousness
.
Indeed
,
he
had
more
,
he
thought
,
since
the
events
at
Ecalpemos
.
Things
had
got
worse
since
then
.
There
had
been
a
gradual
slow
decline
in
his
fortunes
,
his
fate
,
his
happiness
and
his
prosperity
,
or
prospect
of
prosperity
.
Adam
glared
back
at
him
and
looked
away
.
Of
course
he
would
not
want
to
know
me
,
Shiva
thought
.
Lili
asked
him
what
he
was
looking
at
.
"
A
chap
I
used
to
know
years
ago
.
"
Shiva
used
words
like
"
chap
"
now
,
and
"
kiddy
"
,
words
used
by
Indians
wanting
to
sound
like
true
Brits
,
though
he
would
not
have
done
this
once
.
"
Do
you
want
to
go
and
say
hallo
to
him
?
"
"
Alas
and
alack
,
he
does
n't
want
to
know
me
.
I
am
a
poor
Indian
.
He
is
not
the
kind
of
bloke
who
wishes
to
know
his
coloured
brethren
.
"
"
Do
n't
talk
like
that
,
"
said
Lili
.
Shiva
smiled
sadly
and
asked
why
not
but
he
knew
he
was
being
unfair
to
Adam
as
well
as
to
himself
.
Had
they
not
all
agreed
when
they
left
Ecalpemos
and
went
their
separate
ways
that
it.was
to
be
as
if
they
had
never
met
,
known
each
other
,
lived
together
,
that
in
future
they
must
be
strangers
and
more
than
strangers
?
Adam
,
no
doubt
,
adhered
to
this
.
So
,
probably
,
did
Rufus
and
the
girl
.
There
was
something
,
some
quality
,
more
fatalistic
,
more
resigned
,
in
Shiva
.
He
might
deceive
others
but
he
was
incapable
of
deceiving
himself
,
of
pretending
,
of
denying
thoughts
.
It
would
not
have
occurred
to
him
to
attempt
forgetfulness
by
inhibiting
memories
of
Ecalpemos
.
He
remembered
it
every
day
.
"
It
was
at
that
place
I
told
you
about
that
I
knew
him
,
"
he
said
to
Lili
.
"
He
was
one
of
the
group
of
us
there
.
Well
,
he
was
the
one
,
it
was
his
place
.
"
"
All
the
better
not
to
know
him
then
,
"
said
Lili
.
She
bought
their
tickets
.
Adam
had
been
right
,
and
it
was
in
an
east
London
near-ghetto
that
Shiva
lived
.
Lili
tucked
the
two
slips
of
green
cardboard
into
a
fold
of
her
sari
.
She
was
only
half
Indian
,
her
mother
being
a
Viennese
woman
who
had
come
to
England
as
an
au
pair
and
married
a
doctor
from
Darjeeling
,
a
surgical
registrar
in
a
Bradford
hospital
.
When
Lili
grew
up
and
the
doctor
died
her
mother
went
home
and
settled
in
Salzburg
,
selling
Glockenturm
beer
mugs
in
a
souvenir
shop
.
It
was
there
that
they
went
each
summer
,
in
Shiva
's
holidays
,
their
fares
paid
by
Sabine
Schnitzler
who
,
having
reverted
to
her
maiden
name
and
largely
to
her
native
tongue
,
sometimes
wore
a
surprised
,
even
bewildered
,
look
at
being
surrounded
,
as
she
put
it
,
by
"
all
those
Indians
"
.
For
Lili
,
whose
skin
was
nearly
as
white
as
Adam
Verne-Smith
's
,
was
more
Indian
than
true
Indians
,
wore
the
sari
,
grew
her
curly
brown
Austrian
hair
down
to
her
waist
and
took
language
lessons
from
a
Bengali
neighbour
of
theirs
.
In
her
voice
were
hints
of
the
sing-song
tone
,
Welsh
in
its
rhythms
,
so
characteristic
of
the
Indian
speaking
English
.
Shiva
thought
he
should
be
grateful
for
all
this
,
though
he
was
not
.
How
would
he
have
felt
,
he
sometimes
asked
himself
,
if
he
had
married
a
woman
who
set
herself
against
his
ethnic
origins
?
He
had
told
Lili
about
Ecalpemos
before
they
married
.
It
would
not
have
been
in
his
nature
,
nor
would
he
have
been
inclined
,
to
do
otherwise
-
But
he
had
not
gone
into
details
,
giving
only
the
bare
outline
,
the
facts
,
and
Lili
had
asked
few
questions
.
He
bore
in
mind
that
the
time
might
come
when
he
would
have
to
tell
her
everything
.
"
It
was
n't
your
fault
,
"
she
had
finally
said
.
"
It
's
true
that
they
never
consulted
me
.
If
I
had
given
my
advice
it
would
have
been
ignored
.
"
"
Well
,
then
.
"
He
began
haltingly
to
explain
,
but
stopped
himself
.
He
could
tell
the
truth
but
not
all
the
truth
.
Openness
did
not
demand
that
he
tell
her
he
had
suggested
it
.
"
You
should
try
to
forget
,
"
she
said
.
"
I
suppose
I
feel
that
would
be
wrong
.
I
ought
never
to
forget
about
the
kiddy
.
"
And
it
was
perhaps
inevitable
that
he
should
see
the
death
of
his
own
child
,
his
and
Lili
's
,
as
retribution
,
as
a
just
punishment
.
Yet
he
was
not
a
Christian
,
to
look
at
things
in
this
light
.
He
was
not
really
a
Hindu
either
.
His
parents
had
neglected
this
aspect
of
his
upbringing
,
having
largely
abandoned
their
religion
but
for
a
few
outer
forms
before
he
was
born
.
Some
lingering
race
memory
remained
though
,
some
pervading
conviction
common
to
all
Orientals
,
that
this
life
was
but
one
of
many
on
the
great
wheel
of
existence
and
that
reincarnation
as
someone
better
endowed
or
worse
(
in
his
case
surely
worse
)
awaited
him
.
He
saw
himself
returning
as
a
beggar
with
limbs
deliberately
deformed
,
whining
for
alms
on
the
sea-front
at
Bombay
.
The
incongruity
was
that
at
the
same
time
he
was
convinced
of
retribution
in
this
world
.
He
saw
the
death
of
his
son
,
a
placenta
previa
child
who
died
during
Lili
's
labour
,
as
direct
vengeance
,
though
he
could
not
have
said
who
was
exacting
it
.
Crossing
the
hospital
courtyard
which
divided
the
maternity
wing
from
the
general
wards
and
administration
building
,
hearing
over
and
over
in
his
head
the
words
they
had
gently
but
coldly
told
him
,
the
announcement
of
his
son
's
death
,
leaving
Lili
asleep
,
carefully
sedated
,
he
had
lifted
his
eyes
and
seen
Rufus
Fletcher
.
Rufus
was
wearing
a
white
coat
and
had
a
stethoscope
hanging
round
his
neck
.
He
was
walking
very
rapidly
,
far
faster
than
Shiva
was
going
in
the
opposite
direction
,
from
a
building
with
long
windows
and
white-uniformed
men
and
girls
behind
them
that
looked
like
a
lab
,
towards
the
main
block
.
He
turned
his
head
to
look
at
Shiva
,
cast
on
him
an
indifferent
glance
,
and
turned
away
.
Rufus
had
simply
not
known
who
he
was
,
Shiva
was
sure
of
that
,
had
not
recognized
him
as
one
of
the
other
two
male
members
of
the
little
community
in
which
they
had
all
lived
in
such
contiguity
for
something
like
two
months
.
Shiva
was
astonished
to
find
that
Rufus
had
in
fact
finished
his
studies
and
become
a
doctor
.
Of
course
he
had
known
Rufus
had
this
in
mind
,
was
three
years
through
his
time
at
medical
school
,
had
already
considerable
knowledge
and
nous
-
who
could
forget
that
?
-
but
somehow
he
had
imagined
that
the
same
fate
would
have
overtaken
the
others
as
had
overtaken
him
,
a
deathly
stultifying
,
an
inhibition
on
all
that
was
ambitious
and
of
ascendant
character
,
a
remorseful
withdrawing
into
the
shade
.
Only
if
they
did
not
show
their
faces
,
only
if
they
kept
their
heads
low
and
lived
in
obscure
corners
,
could
they
hope
to
pass
at
least
in
physical
safety
through
life
.
So
he
had
thought
.
But
the
others
evidently
had
not
,
or
Rufus
had
not
,
walking
jauntily
and
with
swinging
stride
across
the
tarmac
,
his
stethoscope
bobbing
up
and
down
,
letting
himself
into
the
main
hospital
block
,
Shiva
later
saw
,
by
a
door
marked
"
Private
"
,
which
he
slammed
behind
him
with
a
fine
disregard
for
the
notices
exhorting
all
to
silence
.
Lili
had
had
no
more
babies
.
Perhaps
they
would
have
another
child
one
day
.
Lili
was
still
under
thirty
and
there
was
no
reason
,
the
hospital
staff
had
said
,
why
such
an
unfortunate
thing
as
a
placenta
previa
should
occur
again
,
or
if
it
did
,
they
would
be
ready
for
it
.
Shiva
was
not
too
keen
.
The
area
in
which
they
lived
was
overcrowded
and
unsalubrious
and
if
there
was
rather
less
unemployment
than
in
the
north
of
England
,
that
was
about
all
that
could
be
said
for
it
.
The
name
of
their
street
was
Fifth
Avenue
.
It
is
not
the
custom
in
English
cities
to
name
streets
by
numbers
but
it
has
happened
.
There
are
,
for
instance
,
no
less
than
fourteen
First
Avenues
in
the
London
area
,
twelve
Second
Avenues
,
nine
Third
Avenues
and
three
Fourth
Avenues
.
The
only
other
Fifth
Avenues
are
in
West
Kilburn
and
Manor
Park
,
both
of
which
also
possess
a
Sixth
,
while
the
latter
possesses
a
Seventh
.
Shiva
's
Fifth
Avenue
was
a
long
,
curving
,
treeless
street
that
dipped
steeply
down
and
switchbacked
up
again
,
though
the
neighbourhood
was
not
in
general
a
particularly
hilly
place
.
At
the
end
nearest
the
tube
station
was
a
block
of
shops
containing
a
small
supermarket
run
by
Pakistanis
,
a
Greek
restaurant
run
by
Cypriots
,
a
triple-fronted
emporium
given
over
to
the
sale
of
motor-cycle
spare
parts
and
equipment
and
a
paper
shop
run
by
people
who
when
asked
where
they
came
from
ingenuously
replied
that
they
were
Cape
Coloureds
.
In
the
middle
of
Fifth
Avenue
,
where
Pevsner
Road
crossed
it
,
was
another
small
grocer
's
and
a
pub
called
the
Boxer
,
and
at
the
far
end
,
opposite
each
other
,
a
unisex
hairdresser
's
and
a
betting
shop
.
These
were
linked
by
belts
of
houses
in
infrequently
broken
blocks
,
composed
of
bricks
in
a
dull
purplish
red
or
khaki
yellow
,
and
all
now
between
ninety-seven
and
ninety-nine
years
old
.
A
double
line
of
parked
cars
ran
parallel
to
the
pavements
from
the
paper
shop
to
the
pub
and
the
grocer
's
to
the
hairdresser
's
.
If
you
half-closed
your
eyes
and
looked
at
it
you
might
have
likened
it
to
a
string
of
coloured
beads
.
Shiva
went
into
the
paper
shop
.
There
were
two
Jamaican
boys
in
there
and
they
made
a
point
of
crowding
the
counter
,
holding
their
elbows
akimbo
,
so
that
Shiva
was
unable
to
pick
up
his
paper
from
the
pile
in
front
of
them
.
Quietly
he
asked
for
the
Standard
and
handed
across
his
money
between
the
jutting
arms
;
he
did
n't
want
any
trouble
.
It
was
the
Indians
they
hated
down
here
,
not
the
whites
.
Well
,
there
were
few
whites
left
except
for
very
old
people
who
could
n't
have
moved
if
they
had
wanted
to
.
Lili
was
waiting
outside
,
standing
between
their
cases
.
She
was
very
brave
,
he
thought
,
to
wear
the
sari
and
shop
in
the
Indian
shops
and
have
her
Bengali
lessons
when
all
these
things
drew
attention
to
her
.
It
would
have
been
easy
for
her
to
pass
for
a
white
girl
.
Only
her
eyes
,
distinctive
dark
bluish-brown
,
with
somewhat
protuberant
,
bluish
whites
,
betrayed
her
.
But
people
were
not
that
perceptive
and
for
God
's
sake
this
was
London
,
not
Johannesburg
in
the
fifties
.
She
could
have
got
away
with
it
and
he
had
more
than
once
suggested
she
should
,
begged
her
almost
.
But
it
was
her
identity
,
she
said
,
it
was
all
she
had
,
and
she
went
on
putting
a
caste
mark
which
she
had
no
right
to
on
her
forehead
and
wearing
all
her
gold
bracelets
and
cooking
sag
ghosht
and
dal
instead
of
the
defrosted
hamburgers
and
chips
which
was
what
most
people
ate
around
there
.
He
picked
up
the
cases
and
she
took
their
hand-cases
and
they
walked
home
,
passing
three
separate
black
people
who
looked
at
them
with
silent
hostility
and
two
elderly
white
women
who
did
not
look
at
them
at
all
.
Lili
would
start
unpacking
at
once
.
She
would
put
all
the
light
clothes
into
one
bag
and
all
the
dark
into
another
and
take
them
to
the
launderette
in
Pevsner
Road
.
He
knew
it
would
be
useless
to
try
and
hinder
this
,
she
would
be
fidgety
and
fretful
if
there
were
dirty
clothes
about
.
So
long
as
she
was
n't
out
after
dark
,
he
supposed
it
would
be
all
right
.
Nothing
much
could
happen
to
her
on
a
sunny
September
afternoon
between
here
and
the
launderette
,
and
Mrs
Barakhda
who
ran
it
was
a
friend
of
hers
,
or
the
nearest
Lili
had
to
a
friend
.
He
made
her
a
cup
of
tea
while
she
sorted
the
washing
,
closed
up
the
cases
and
pushed
them
into
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
.
At
least
they
had
a
whole
house
,
with
three
bedrooms
.
Most
of
the
houses
down
here
were
divided
into.two
flats
,
two
front
doors
squeezed
in
under
the
tiny
porch
.
He
offered
to
carry
the
bags
for
her
but
she
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
In
her
reactionary
way
-
for
Lili
had
been
brought
up
by
an
independent
,
feminist
mother
-
she
thought
it
all
right
for
men
to
carry
suitcases
but
not
bags
of
washing
.
With
his
second
cup
of
tea
in
front
of
him
,
he
sat
down
to
look
at
the
newspaper
.
There
was
a
big
picture
of
the
Princess
of
Wales
visiting
a
home
for
handicapped
children
.
The
main
story
was
about
trouble
in
the
Middle
East
and
a
subsidiary
one
about
racial
trouble
in
West
London
,
street
fighting
mainly
and
breaking
shop
windows
.
Shiva
's
eye
travelled
down
the
page
.
At
the
foot
of
one
of
the
left-hand
columns
he
read
a
headline
.
For
the
amount
of
text
underneath
it
,
a
mere
paragraph
,
it
was
a
disproportionately
large
headline
.
It
even
rather
spoiled
the
symmetry
of
the
page
.
The
headline
said
:
"
Skeleton
Found
in
Woodland
Grave
"
,
and
the
story
beneath
it
ran
:
"
While
digging
a
grave
for
his
pet
dog
a
Suffolk
landowner
,
with
a
home
near
Hadleigh
,
unearthed
a
human
skeleton
.
The
remains
appear
to
be
those
of
a
young
woman
.
Police
declined
to
comment
further
at
this
stage
and
Mr
Alec
Chipstead
,
a
chartered
surveyor
,
was
not
available
for
questioning
.
"
Shiva
read
it
twice
.
It
was
rather
strangely
put
,
he
thought
.
He
felt
this
about
most
accounts
and
articles
in
newspapers
.
They
did
n't
know
much
but
they
told
you
what
they
did
know
in
the
most
cryptic
way
possible
to
whet
your
appetite
and
make
you
speculate
.
For
instance
,
they
did
n't
tell
you
if
the
landowner
and
Mr
Alec
Chipstead
were
one
and
the
same
person
,
though
you
could
tell
that
was
what
they
meant
.
He
could
feel
sweat
standing
on
his
face
,
on
his
upper
lip
and
forehead
.
Wiping
it
away
with
his
handkerchief
,
he
closed
his
eyes
,
opened
them
and
looked
round
the
room
,
then
back
at
the
newsprint
in
front
of
him
,
as
if
he
might
have
been
dreaming
or
have
imagined
it
.
The
paragraph
,
of
course
,
was
still
there
.
There
was
no
reason
,
Shiva
thought
after
the
first
shock
had
subsided
,
to
suppose
any
connection
between
this
find
and
Ecalpemos
.
Suffolk
was
the
only
link
and
he
could
remember
quite
distinctly
,
on
first
going
to
Nunes
,
how
there
had
been
some
dispute
as
to
whether
it
was
in
Suffolk
or
Essex
.
The
blurring
of
boundaries
,
which
took
place
at
about
that
time
,
had
created
such
anomalies
as
a
householder
having
an
Essex
postal
address
while
paying
his
rates
to
Suffolk
County
Council
.
This
,
surely
,
was
what
had
actually
happened
to
Adam
Verne-Smith
.
It
was
not
quite
true
that
this
was
the
only
connecting
link
.
The
other
,
of
course
,
was
the
body
,
the
young
woman
's
body
.
Shiva
thought
,
I
must
wait
for
more
news
,
I
must
bear
it
and
wait
.
His
patient
was
getting
on
for
fifty
,
a
handsome
,
tall
woman
,
very
well-dressed
.
Her
expensive
clothes
-
Jasper
Conran
,
he
guessed
-
she
had
put
on
again
and
,
while
behind
the
screen
,
a
little
more
lipstick
.
He
had
just
done
a
smear
test
on
her
.
"
You
have
a
very
nice
inside
,
"
he
told
her
,
smiling
.
The
nurse
smiled
too
.
She
could
afford
to
,
being
twenty
years
younger
and
with
her
gynaecological
problems
,
if
any
,
taken
care
of
by
Dr
Fletcher
for
free
.
Mrs
Strawson
said
she
was
very
glad
to
hear
it
.
She
looked
happy
and
relaxed
.
Rufus
gave
her
a
cigarette
.
One
of
the
many
aspects
of
his
personality
which
endeared
him
to
his
patients
-
the
others
being
good
looks
,
charm
,
youth
,
boyishness
and
treating
them
like
equals
-
was
his
inability
to
give
up
smoking
.
"
I
am
that
monstrous
sinner
,
"
he
would
say
to
them
,
"
the
doctor
that
smokes
.
Each
one
of
us
is
said
to
be
worth
fifty
thousand
pounds
of
advertising
per
year
to
the
tobacco
companies
.
"
And
the
patient
,
especially
if
she
did
n't
smoke
,
would
feel
empathy
for
him
and
maternal
towards
him
.
Poor
boy
,
with
all
that
stress
,
he
works
so
hard
,
it
's
only
natural
he
needs
something
to
keep
him
going
.
Mrs
Strawson
inhaled
gratefully
.
This
was
her
first
visit
to
Rufus
Fletcher
in
Wimpole
Street
and
she
was
already
delighted
to
have
taken
up
her
friend
's
recommendation
.
"
Now
how
about
contraception
?
Do
you
mind
telling
me
what
method
you
're
using
?
"
After
that
implication
that
she
was
still
in
the
prime
of
her
fertile
years
,
Mrs
Strawson
would
n't
have
minded
telling
him
anything
.
An
account
of
an
ancient
intra-uterine
device
,
implanted
twenty
years
before
and
never
since
then
disturbed
,
made
them
all
laugh
once
more
.
Rufus
,
however
,
suggested
he
should
take
a
look
,
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
.
The
Jasper
Conran
dress
removed
once
more
,
Mrs
Strawson
got
back
on
the
couch
.
Rufus
had
a
probe
around
.
It
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
the
thing
she
had
surprisingly
described
as
being
shaped
like
a
Greek
alpha
was
still
there
or
not
.
His
thoughts
wandered
to
the
Standard
which
he
had
folded
up
and
stuffed
into
the
top
drawer
of
his
desk
when
Mrs
Strawson
was
announced
.
It
could
not
refer
to
the
events
of
ten
years
past
,
of
course
it
could
n't
.
If
it
had
been
the
house
and
the
body
it
would
surely
have
referred
not
to
digging
a
woodland
grave
but
to
digging
in
an
animal
cemetery
.
They
would
not
have
got
that
wrong
.
Rufus
had
forgotten
how
often
he
castigated
the
press
for
inaccuracy
,
how
he
constantly
said
to
Marigold
that
you
could
n't
believe
a
word
you
read
.
He
told
-
or
,
rather
,
politely
asked
-
Mrs
Strawson
to
get
dressed
again
.
"
If
we
attempted
to
remove
it
,
"
he
said
to
her
,
"
it
would
have
to
be
done
under
anaesthetic
.
I
do
n't
suppose
you
want
that
,
do
you
?
It
's
not
harming
you
.
Rather
the
reverse
,
I
should
say
.
It
seems
to
have
done
you
proud
.
Why
not
let
it
continue
with
the
good
work
?
"
He
sometimes
thought
how
astonished
,
how
appalled
indeed
,
many
of
these
women
would
be
if
they
knew
that
these
intra-uterine
devices
were
not
in
fact
contraceptives
but
abortifacients
.
Before
the
IUD
could
do
its
work
conception
must
already
have
taken
place
,
egg
and
sperm
having
fused
in
a
fallopian
,
and
the
multiplying
cells
travelled
down
to
the
womb
to
seek
a
place
of
anchorage
,
a
home
which
the
alpha-shaped
loop
by
its
very
presence
denied
them
,
causing
the
minute
beginnings
of
an
embryo
to
swim
in
vain
and
ultimately
be
shed
.
Rufus
did
not
in
the
least
care
about
the
moral
issue
,
but
the
subject
itself
interested
him
.
He
had
long
ago
decided
never
to
say
a
word
about
it
to
any
of
his
patients
.
Marigold
,
his
wife
,
he
would
not
of
course
have
permitted
to
give
womb-room
to
such
a
foreign
body
or
to
take
the
pill
or
consider
any
so-called
reversible
tube-tyings
.
In
his
own
bed
in
Mill
Hill
Rufus
used
a
sheath
or
practised
coitus
interruptus
,
which
he
prided
himself
on
being
rather
good
at
.
He
said
that
was
all
,
thank
you
,
to
Mrs
Strawson
,
he
would
let
her
know
the
result
of
the
smear
,
and
he
walked
all
the
way
back
to
the
reception
desk
with
her
where
her
£40
fee
was
taken
from
her
.
They
shook
hands
and
Rufus
wished
her
a
pleasant
journey
home
to
Sevenoaks
,
she
would
just
be
in
time
to
avoid
the
rush
.
He
was
aware
of
the
accusation
frequently
levelled
at
doctors
of
his
sort
,
that
they
are
charming
to
their
private
patients
who
pay
them
,
while
treating
like
so
many
malfunctioning
machines
their
National
Health
patients
who
merely
pay
the
state
.
He
was
aware
of
this
and
in
principle
disliked
it
,
attempting
when
he
first
set
up
in
private
practice
,
to
resist
it
,
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
.
In
this
land
of
two
nations
he
was
not
big
enough
to
be
one
of
the
just
.
At
the
hospital
with
its
crowd
of
out-patients
and
wards
full
of
in-patients
he
was
so
busy
,
so
plagued
and
hassled
and
rushed
off
his
feet
,
and
the
women
so
submissive
and
ignorant
or
merely
sullen
,
that
he
forgot
about
principles
.
Nor
did
they
speak
nicely
or
carry
handbags
from
Etienne
Aigner
in
which
reposed
American
Express
Gold
Cards
.
These
two
sorts
of
women
seemed
to
belong
to
different
species
,
being
sisters
only
under
their
knickers
,
whether
these
came
from
Janet
Reger
or
the
British
Home
Stores
.
The
treatment
Rufus
meted
out
to
them
was
after
all
,
the
same
.
Special
care
he
reserved
for
his
own
wife
and
not
for
the
Mrs
Strawsons
of
this
world
.
She
was
his
last
patient
of
the
day
.
At
this
particular
time
he
liked
to
begin
the
unwinding
process
.
Whatever
shamefaced
and
boyish
confessions
he
might
make
to
his
patients
,
he
controlled
his
smoking
,
rationing
himself
to
between
ten
and
fifteen
a
day
.
But
in
the
afternoons
he
always
smoked
two
after
the
last
patient
had
gone
.
He
sat
smoking
his
cigarettes
and
reading
the
evening
paper
for
the
half-hour
it
took
to
accomplish
these
combined
exercises
,
before
leaving
and
getting
into
the
tube
at
Bond
Street
.
Today
this
usually
pleasurable
half-hour
was
spoilt
by
the
paragraph
he
had
read
prior
to
the
arrival
of
Mrs
Strawson
.
His
nurse
had
brought
the
paper
back
from
her
lunch
break
and
left
it
lying
on
the
low
coffee
table
during
his
appointments
with
his
two
previous
patients
.
It
was
because
Mrs
Strawson
was
five
minutes
late
-
behaviour
he
made
no
demur
at
,
though
he
would
have
refused
to
see
a
National
Health
patient
who
failed
to
turn
up
on
time
-
that
he
had
picked
up
the
Standard
and
seen
that
paragraph
.
The
half-hour
was
spoilt
but
Rufus
,
just
the
same
,
was
a
disciplined
man
.
He
had
not
got
where
he
was
at
the
age
of
thirty-three
by
giving
way
to
pointless
speculation
and
neurotic
inner
enquiry
.
To
have
recovered
as
he
had
done
,
so
successfully
,
so
brilliantly
,
after
such
a
traumatic
experience
,
had
been
a
considerable
feat
.
He
had
subjected
himself
to
his
own
personal
therapy
,
requiring
himself
to
sit
alone
in
a
hospital
room
and
speak
of
those
happenings
aloud
.
He
had
been
therapist
and
client
both
,
had
asked
the
questions
and
supplied
the
answers
,
aiming
at
total
frankness
,
keeping
nothing
back
,
expressing
to
those
bare
walls
,
that
metal
table
and
black-leather
swivel
chair
,
that
window
with
its
half-drawn
,
dark-blue
blind
,
the
crawling
distastes
and
shames
,
the
self-disgust
,
the
shrinking
from
light
and
the
fear
which
seemed
sometimes
to
beat
with
frenzied
wings
against
bars
in
his
brain
.
It
had
worked
-
up
to
a
point
.
This
stuff
(
as
he
put
it
to
himself
)
often
does
work
up
to
a
point
.
The
point
,
though
,
is
on
a
rather
low
threshold
.
Getting
it
all
out
and
so
getting
rid
of
it
-
well
,
yes
.
Nobody
tells
you
how
it
comes
back
again
.
With
Rufus
it
did
to
some
extent
come
back
again
and
all
he
could
do
was
grind
it
down
and
soldier
on
.
Time
,
the
best
of
all
doctors
,
though
he
kills
you
in
the
end
,
had
done
more
than
therapy
could
and
now
days
would
pass
,
weeks
,
without
Rufus
thinking
of
Ecalpemos
at
all
.
For
quite
long
periods
of
time
it
went
away
and
he
forgot
it
.
The
associative
process
did
not
work
with
Rufus
in
quite
the
same
way
as
it
did
with
his
erstwhile
friend
,
Adam
Verne-Smith
,
for
Adam
was
an
"
arts
"
person
and
he
a
scientist
,
so
that
Greek
or
Spanish
names
,
for
instance
,
evoked
none
of
it
.
Ecalpemos
,
after
all
,
was
not
Greek
and
did
not
even
sound
so
to
Rufus
who
,
unlike
Adam
,
had
not
received
a
classical
education
.
Nor
was
he
neurotically
sensitive
about
babies
.
It
would
hardly
have
done
him
much
good
in
his
professional
life
,
where
women
were
always
wanting
to
know
if
they
were
having
them
or
how
to
stop
them
or
conceive
them
,
if
he
had
been
.
He
had
long
ago
got
the
whole
business
of
Ecalpemos
under
tight
control
and
lived
in
high
hopes
of
never
having
to
refer
to
it
again
in
word
or
thought
-
and
then
there
had
appeared
this
paragraph
.
If
the
house
they
referred
to
,
thought
Rufus
,
had
been
Wyvis
Hall
,
why
had
they
not
said
so
?
Or
said
"
near
Nunes
"
rather
than
"
near
Hadleigh
"
?
The
place
had
certainly
been
nearer
Nunes
than
Hadleigh
,
three
miles
nearer
,
though
of
course
Hadleigh
was
a
town
and
Nunes
merely
a
small
village
.
There
were
a
great
many
houses
in
the
vicinity
of
Hadleigh
of
the
same
sort
of
size
as
Wyvis
Hall
and
a
newspaper
would
be
likely
to
describe
anyone
who
possessed
a
few
acres
as
a
"
landowner
"
.
For
all
he
knew
it
might
not
be
unusual
to
unearth
human
bones
in
grounds
such
as
these
.
Possibly
they
were
ancient
bones
-
The
only
really
hard
piece
of
information
the
Standard
gave
was
the
name
of
the
present
owner
of
the
house
:
Alec
Chipstead
.
A
chartered
surveyor
,
it
said
.
Rufus
stubbed
out
his
second
cigarette
,
put
the
paper
into
his
briefcase
and
slung
over
his
shoulders
the
marvellous
black
leather
coat
from
Beltrami
he
had
bought
in
Florence
,
which
would
have
made
him
look
like
a
gangster
if
he
had
not
been
so
fair
and
ruddy-faced
and
with
such
blue
,
English
eyes
.
He
said
good-night
to
his
nurse
and
to
the
receptionist
and
walked
off
down
the
street
,
across
Wigmore
Street
towards
Henrietta
Place
.
It
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
go
into
any
public
library
where
they
kept
phone
directories
for
the
whole
country
and
look
up
Alec
Chipstead
and
see
if
his
address
was
Wyvis
Hall
.
There
might
well
be
a
public
library
very
near
where
he
was
now
walking
.
Rufus
told
himself
now
was
no
time
to
go
hunting
for
libraries
,
he
would
go
home
first
.
He
would
go
home
and
think
what
to
do
.
He
had
an
idea
it
was
a
rule
with
libraries
to
stay
open
late
on
Thursday
evenings
.
Deliberately
,
he
switched
his
thoughts
.
Library
or
no
library
,
he
would
take
Marigold
out
to
dinner
.
Hampstead
somewhere
,
he
thought
,
and
then
he
might
take
the
opportunity
to
slip
into
the
big
library
at
Swiss
Cottage
-
No
more
of
that
.
Over
dinner
they
would
talk
about
moving
house
.
Rufus
thought
he
was
growing
out
of
Mill
Hill
and
it
was
time
to
consider
a
move
to
Hampstead
.
Marigold
would
have
preferred
Highgate
,
he
knew
,
but
in
spite
of
the
therapy
and
the
control
he
shied
away
from
Highgate
.
These
places
were
all
villages
really
,
you
got
to
know
the
neighbours
,
met
people
at
parties
and
,
given
that
you
were
a
middle-class
professional
person
,
there
was
a
limited
number
of
like
people
it
was
possible
to
meet
.
Suppose
he
were
to
encounter
the
Ryemarks
or
even
Robin
Tatian
?
No
,
it
was
unthinkable
.
A
house
in
Hampstead
would
mean
taking
on
an
astronomical
mortgage
,
but
so
what
?
Take
what
you
want
,
have
what
you
like
,
he
had
read
somewhere
,
and
drag
your
income
along
behind
you
.
He
was
doing
well
,
anyway
,
getting
more
patients
each
month
,
would
soon
have
more
than
he
could
comfortably
cope
with
.
The
means
he
used
for
getting
home
was
the
Central
Line
to
Tottenham
Court
Road
and
then
the
Northern
Line
to
Colindale
,
where
he
had
left
his
car
.
Rufus
made
it
into
the
train
before
the
rush
began
.
Something
happened
which
always
pleased
him
:
his
wife
opened
the
front
door
to
him
just
as
he
was
about
to
put
his
key
in
the
lock
.
Marigold
's
name
suited
her
.
She
was
tall
and
generously
built
and
fair
,
with
a
high
colour
and
a
red
mouth
and
white
teeth
.
In
other
words
,
she
looked
a
lot
like
him
.
If
not
twins
,
they
might
have
been
taken
for
brother
and
sister
.
Rufus
was
one
of
those
people
who
admire
their
own
kind
of
looks
better
than
any
other
sort
and
whose
partners
are
chosen
because
they
belong
in
the
same
type
as
themselves
.
Soon
after
he
met
Marigold
he
had
taken
her
to
the
opera
to
see
Die
Walküre
and
afterwards
had
said
without
forethought
:
"
The
Brünnhilde
was
all
wrong
.
She
should
have
looked
like
you
.
"
She
had
made
some
preparations
for
their
dinner
but
she
did
n't
object
to
going
out
.
She
never
did
.
It
was
n't
yet
five-thirty
,
but
not
too
early
,
in
Rufus
's
opinion
,
for
a
drink
.
He
looked
forward
to
this
drink
,
the
first
of
the
day
,
with
a
sensuous
desire
.
Any
white
spirit
would
do
for
him
,
he
was
n't
fussy
,
and
he
poured
himself
a
stiff
vodka
,
some
of
that
Polish
stuff
they
had
brought
back
from
their
Black
Sea
summer
holiday
.
It
flooded
his
head
,
charged
it
with
recklessness
and
brought
-
he
could
feel
it
happening
-
a
warm
flush
to
his
face
.
"
We
'll
go
out
and
drink
a
lot
and
get
pissed
,
"
he
said
.
He
gave
her
his
golden
ferocious
grin
.
She
knew
that
grin
,
it
meant
something
had
happened
,
but
she
was
n't
going
to
ask
what
.
Let
him
tell
her
if
he
liked
.
There
was
a
lot
of
underlying
violence
in
Rufus
,
and
not
all
that
underlying
either
,
a
lion-like
aggression
in
times
of
stress
that
took
the
form
of
a
whooping
,
destructive
merriment
.
She
did
n't
mind
that
,
though
sometimes
she
had
a
prevision
that
one
day
,
when
he
was
a
rheumy
old
lion
and
she
a
worn-out
,
weary
lioness
,
she
might
mind
it
very
much
.
"
Go
and
put
on
something
beautiful
,
"
he
said
at
seven
,
after
he
had
had
two
overt
vodkas
,
and
poured
,
as
was
his
habit
,
a
single
,
large
,
secret
one
,
and
had
taken
her
to
bed
.
Marigold
disappeared
into
the
bathroom
.
Rufus
,
sleek
with
love
and
ardent
spirits
,
thought
with
wonder
about
how
he
had
actually
imagined
for
all
of
ten
minutes
that
the
house
they
talked
about
in
the
Standard
might
be
Wyvis
Hall
.
It
amused
him
for
a
moment
to
speculate
about
the
others
,
if
they
too
had
seen
the
paragraph
and
whether
they
had
been
astonished
and
afraid
.
The
five
of
them
,
he
repeated
their
names
silently
:
Adam
,
himself
,
Shiva
,
Vivien
and
-
Zosie
.
They
would
be
more
discomposed
than
he
.
Discomposed
,
he
thought
,
a
word
entirely
different
in
meaning
(
as
Adam
himself
might
have
pointed
out
)
from
its
near-homophone
,
de
composed
.
There
was
no
point
in
dwelling
on
that
.
He
and
Adam
had
been
at
the
same
school
,
though
he
was
a
bit
older
.
From
the
day
they
had
all
parted
,
diverging
from
Ecalpemos
out
into
the
world
,
he
had
never
seen
Adam
again
,
but
he
knew
all
about
him
,
knew
for
instance
that
he
had
become
a
partner
in
a
company
selling
computers
that
called
itself
Verne-Smith-Duchini
.
And
old
man
Verne-Smith
and
his
wife
,
he
knew
,
lived
no
more
than
a
mile
away
,
but
them
he
avoided
out
of
simple
antipathy
.
What
had
the
Indian
's
surname
been
?
He
had
heard
it
,
but
not
often
,
it
was
a
strange
one
and
it
escaped
him
.
Manresa
?
No
,
that
was
a
town
in
Spain
and
a
street
in
Chelsea
.
Malgudi
?
A
place
in
the
novels
of
R.
K.
Narayan
that
Marigold
read
.
Anyway
,
it
was
something
of
that
sort
.
Vivien
had
been
called
Goldman
,
not
particularly
euphonious
or
attractive
,
that
.
And
Zosie
?
What
was
Zosie
's
name
?
He
got
out
of
bed
and
put
his
clothes
on
,
the
same
clothes
but
a
clean
shirt
.
Marigold
was
running
a
bath
,
stepping
into
the
water
.
She
always
made
a
great
splashing
.
Secrecy
was
a
necessary
ingredient
of
Rufus
's
life
.
Even
if
the
things
he
kept
from
his
wife
-
had
once
kept
from
parents
,
brother
,
girlfriends
-
were
very
minor
,
he
had
to
have
them
,
had
,
if
need
be
,
to
create
them
.
The
photograph
was
one
,
of
these
.
All
these
years
he
had
had
it
and
kept
it
for
safety
and
secrecy
's
sake
inside
a
boring
medical
book
.
Not
one
of
those
books
on
healthy
vaginas
and
wombs
which
Marigold
might
easily
have
looked
into
but
a
work
on
the
nasty
bacilli
which
may
infest
the
human
reproductive
organs
after
a
bungled
or
septic
abortion
.
Rufus
had
not
looked
at
the
picture
for
years
.
It
was
still
there
,
though
,
and
looking
at
it
gave
him
a
shock
.
If
it
was
possible
to
be
surprised
by
a
shock
Rufus
was
surprised
.
He
had
thought
he
could
look
at
a
picture
of
Wyvis
Hall
,
a
photograph
he
had
taken
himself
with
a
cheap
camera
Zosie
had
stolen
,
with
equanimity
and
even
a
rueful
amusement
,
but
it
appeared
he
could
not
.
It
made
him
feel
chilled
and
sober
,
as
if
the
love
and
vodka
had
never
been
.
"
I
will
get
pissed
tonight
,
by
God
,
"
he
said
aloud
.
"
And
why
not
?
"
The
house
stood
remote
,
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
,
on
the
side
of
a
river
valley
,
embowered
in
trees
of
many
kinds
.
Woodland
,
Rufus
thought
,
a
woodland
grave
.
It
had
been
built
in
the
late
eighteenth
century
,
two
storeys
high
,
shallow
slate
roof
,
red
brick
,
seven
windows
set
in
ashlar
along
the
upper
floor
,
six
below
and
the
front
door
set
centrally
under
a
portico
and
pillared
porch
.
A
chimney
at
each
end
.
Outbuildings
,
the
stable
block
.
In
front
a
broad
sweep
of
gravel
,
and
this
side
of
it
,
just
in
the
picture
,
a
rolling
lawn
with
a
cedar
set
in
it
,
a
huge
,
black
,
ungainly
tree
that
lurched
like
a
galleon
at
sea
when
the
wind
blew
.
To
take
the
photograph
he
must
have
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
,
under
the
beech
hedge
which
bounded
it
perhaps
.
The
sun
looked
very
bright
,
but
when
had
it
not
been
bright
that
summer
?
Rufus
found
his
heart
was
beating
fast
.
He
even
considered
fetching
his
sphygmomanometer
and
taking
his
blood
pressure
,
simply
out
of
curiosity
.
Instead
he
turned
the
photograph
face-downwards
.
He
then
picked
it
up
delicately
between
thumb
and
forefinger
,
as
if
he
held
something
highly
vulnerable
in
tweezers
.
He
opened
the
medical
book
,
placed
the
photograph
inside
the
chapter
on
Clostridium
welchii
,
a
rod-shaped
bacterium
which
decays
the
body
while
it
is
still
alive
,
and
went
into
his
living
room
.
On
a
window
sill
,
hidden
by
the
curtain
hem
,
was
his
secret
vodka
,
still
half
a
glass
left
.
But
he
was
already
affected
by
a
euphoria
which
induced
courage
and
recklessness
.
His
heart
had
steadied
.
He
wondered
why
he
had
considered
having
recourse
to
a
public
library
when
he
had
a
much
simpler
means
to
hand
of
identifying
the
house
in
the
newspaper
paragraph
.
Now
that
his
consciousness
was
changed
,
how
could
he
possibly
have
allowed
himself
to
speculate
about
its
identity
,
postpone
the
means
of
putting
his
mind
at
rest
and
then
,
ostrich-like
,
avoid
the
issue
altogether
?
This
was
no
way
to
conduct
one
's
life
,
as
he
had
always
maintained
.
You
do
not
shirk
things
,
was
a
first
principle
,
you
face
up
to
them
.
One
of
the
reasons
why
he
drank
a
lot
was
because
it
made
this
possible
.
He
took
a
mouthful
of
the
secret
vodka
,
savouring
it
,
carried
it
to
the
door
,
listened
.
The
water
was
running
out
.
She
would
be
ten
minutes
.
Rufus
picked
up
the
phone
and
dialled
192
.
Directory
enquiries
were
better
about
answering
these
days
than
they
had
used
to
be
.
Something
must
have
given
them
a
shake-up
.
It
was
a
man
's
voice
that
said
,
"
What
town
?
"
It
was
odd
that
he
had
n't
thought
about
that
but
immediately
it
came
back
to
him
,
the
name
of
the
exchange
,
though
Hilbert
's
phone
had
been
disconnected
.
"
Colchester
,
"
he
said
.
Rufus
finished
his
vodka
,
slid
a
cigarette
out
of
the
packet
on
the
shelf
in
front
of
him
.
"
Chipstead
,
"
he
enunciated
carefully
,
and
then
he
spelt
it
.

"

Rufus
,
conscious
of
his
Freudian
slip
.
"
Wyvis
Hall

Nunes
,

"
He
waited
,
anticipating
the
usually
annoying
rejoinder
that
they
had
no
subscriber
of
that
name
on
record
.
In
this
case
it
would
possibly
be
that
they
had
the
name
of
the
subscriber
but
-
The
operator
interrupted
this
thought
.
"
The
number
is
six-two-six-two-oh-one-three
.
"
Rufus
put
the
receiver
back
,
feeling
a
clutch
at
his
stomach
as
if
a
hard
hand
had
made
a
grab
at
the
muscles
.
The
picture
,
very
like
the
one
Rufus
Fletcher
had
taken
in
the
summer
of
1976
,
occupied
the
screen
for
about
fifteen
seconds
.
The
whole
item
was
allowed
no
more
than
four
times
that
in
the
BBC
's
Sunday
evening
news
broadcast
at
6.30
.
The
other
forty-five
seconds
were
taken
up
by
a
policeman
talking
to
a
reporter
about
having
nothing
to
say
except
that
there
would
be
an
inquest
.
But
Shiva
and
Lili
Manjusri
saw
the
picture
and
so
did
Rufus
Fletcher
.
Adam
Verne-Smith
,
unwinding
in
Puerto
de
la
Cruz
,
did
not
of
course
see
it
.
He
did
not
even
see
an
English
newspaper
.
They
were
expensive
to
buy
and
came
a
day
late
.
He
did
not
want
to
be
reminded
of
home
and
the
only
paper
he
even
glanced
at
was
the
International
Herald
Tribune
,
a
copy
of
which
Anne
found
on
the
beach
.
His
father
,
at
home
in
Edgware
,
said
to
his
wife
:
"
Good
God
,
Wyvis
Hall
,
as
I
live
and
breathe
.
"
Beryl
Verne-Smith
peered
,
but
the
picture
immediately
vanished
.
"
Yes
,
I
suppose
it
was
.
"
The
policeman
talked
,
the
reporter
trying
to
jog
him
into
revelations
and
failing
.
In
the
background
,
autumnal
trees
could
be
seen
and
a
church
on
the
summit
of
a
low
hill
.
Lewis
Verne-Smith
sat
shaking
his
head
,
less
as
a
gesture
of
denial
than
of
a
generalized
despair
at
the
state
of
the
world
.
It
was
not
that
unpleasant
memories
were
evoked
,
for
these
were
always
with
him
,
his
existence
was
inseparable
from
that
old
bitterness
,
but
that
a
sight
of
the
house
,
even
the
glimpse
of
a
photograph
,
revived
the
precise
feelings
he
had
had
-
why
,
it
must
be
getting
on
for
eleven
years
ago
.
"
Ten
and
a
half
,
"
said
his
wife
.
"
I
shall
have
to
get
in
touch
with
the
police
.
No
two
ways
about
it
,
I
shall
have
to
get
in
touch
with
them
.
"
"
Not
this
evening
,
surely
?
"
said
Beryl
,
who
wanted
to
watch
Mastermind
.
Lewis
said
nothing
.
The
room
in
which
they
were
sitting
underwent
the
curious
shrinking
process
to
which
it
was
subject
whenever
he
was
reminded
of
Wyvis
Hall
or
his
Uncle
Hilbert
or
even
if
the
county
of
Suffolk
were
mentioned
.
Suddenly
it
grew
small
and
poky
.
The
brick
side-wall
of
his
neighbour
's
house
seemed
to
have
moved
itself
four
or
five
feet
further
towards
the
dividing
fence
,
so
that
it
loomed
offensively
.
Lewis
got
up
and
pulled
the
curtains
across
with
a
pettish
jerk
of
his
hands
.
"
Should
n't
you
wait
until
Adam
gets
back
?
"
Beryl
said
.
"
Why
?
What
would
that
be
in
aid
of
?
"
Beryl
meant
that
Adam
had
been
among
the
previous
owners
of
Wyvis
Hall
while
her
husband
had
not
,
but
she
knew
better
than
to
point
this
out
.
"
There
is
no
one
living
knows
that
lovely
place
better
than
1
.
"
"
That
's
true
.
"
"
I
sha
n't
wait
till
Adam
returns
,
"
Lewis
said
in
that
manner
that
had
once
led
his
daughter
to
call
him
the
Frog
Footman
,
"
but
I
shall
wait
until
tomorrow
.
"
Men
and
women
do
not
usually
put
their
baser
feelings
and
intentions
into
words
,
not
even
in
the
deep
recesses
of
their
own
minds
.
So
Lewis
did
not
say
,
even
to
himself
,
when
he
was
privately
considering
trying
to
get
hold
of
his
son
in
Tenerife
,
that
he
disliked
Adam
and
would
have
been
pleased
to
spoil
his
holiday
.
Instead
,
he
rationalized
his
thoughts
and
justified
himself
Adam
probably
-
indeed
,
almost
certainly
-
knew
nothing
about
the
find
in
the
pine
wood
,
but
Adam
had
once
owned
the
house
and
had
thus
taken
on
a
responsibility
.
He
could
not
shed
that
responsibility
just
because
he
had
sold
the
place
.
Lewis
would
have
agreed
with
Oscar
Wilde
that
our
past
is
what
we
are
.
We
can
not
rid
ourselves
of
it
.
Therefore
it
was
Adam
's
duty
to
come
home
and
face
the
music
,
even
though
this
might
be
no
more
than
a
short
blast
on
a
tin
whistle
.
But
he
had
no
precise
idea
where
Adam
was
and
he
did
not
think
Adam
's
travel
agent
(
a
personal
friend
of
the
young
Verne-Smiths
)
would
tell
him
.
Some
excuse
would
be
made
for
not
telling
him
.
Lewis
's
bark
,
anyway
,
was
always
worse
than
his
bite
.
He
had
virtually
no
bite
,
as
he
had
once
overheard
Adam
say
to
Bridget
,
and
heard
it
with
helpless
chagrin
.
"
A
bloody
good
thing
or
our
childhood
would
have
been
a
misery
instead
of
just
a
bore

Lewis
walked
into
his
local
police
station
in
Edgware
on
Monday
morning
.
They
seemed
surprised
to
see
him
but
not
astonished
.
The
Suffolk
police
had
begun
hunting
up
previous
owners
of
Wyvis
Hall
and
they
had
been
alerted
that
a
Verne-Smith
lived
in
their
area
.
There
were
,
after
all
,
only
two
in
the
London
phone
directory
.
This
might
be
a
bonus
.
He
was
asked
to
wait
and
then
shown
into
a
room
where
a
detective
sergeant
prepared
to
take
a
statement
from
him
.
With
busy
pomposity
Lewis
dictated
it
to
a
typist
and
would
have
gone
on
and
on
had
he
not
been
diplomatically
restrained
.
"
Wyvis
Hall
,
Nunes
,
Suffolk
,
and
the
twenty
acres
of
land
surrounding
it
were
the
property
,
through
his
marriage
,
of
my
uncle
,
Hilbert
Verne-Smith
.
They
came
into
the
possession
of
my
son
Hilbert
John
Adam
Verne-Smith
under
my
uncle
's
will
,
bypassing
myself
,
though
my
son
was
no
more
than
nineteen
at
the
time
of
my
uncle
's
death
.
Being
an
undergraduate
at
the
time
,
my
son
naturally
never
considered
actually
residing
in
the
house
.
He
was
in
agreement
with
my
suggestion
that
the
property
be
sold
and
before
he
returned
to
college
in
the
autumn
of
1976
,
he
took
my
advice
and
placed
house
and
lands
in
the
hands
of
an
estate
agent
.
"
Country
properties
were
not
selling
well
at
the
time
.
£45,000
was
the
asking
price
and
I
was
not
surprised
that
the
sale
,
so
to
speak
,
hung
fire
.
However
,
in
the
spring
of
1977
an
offer
was
made
,
which
my
son
accepted
.
This
sale
later
fell
through
and
it
was
not
until
the
following
August
that
Wyvis
Hall
was
finally
sold
to
a
Mr
and
Mrs
Langan
for
the
much
improved
figure
of
£51,995
.
"
As
far
as
I
know
,
my
son
's
personal
acquaintance
with
Wyvis
Hall
was
confined
to
my
uncle
's
lifetime
when
1
,
my
wife
and
son
and
daughter
frequently
stayed
with
him
.
After
my
uncle
's
death
in
April
1976
he
visited
Wyvis
Hall
on
perhaps
two
,
or
at
the
most
three
,
separate
occasions
simply
for
the
purpose
of
looking
it
over
and
reaching
a
decision
about
the
disposal
of
furniture
and
effects
.
"
I
suppose
it
is
possible
that
squatters
or
other
vagrants
took
possession
of
the
house
between
the
time
of
my
uncle
's
death
and
the
sale
of
the
property
.
Certainly
my
son
never
let
it
or
allowed
anyone
to
occupy
it
on
either
a
temporary
or
permanent
basis
.
"
My
son
is
at
present
on
holiday
in
Tenerife
with
his
wife
and
daughter
.
I
can
not
say
precisely
when
I
expect
him
to
return
,
though
I
should
suppose
in
about
a
week
from
now
.
"
It
was
all
very
small
and
quiet
and
low-key
.
The
snippet
in
Rufus
's
Monday
morning
newspaper
measured
just
an
inch
in
depth
.
It
answered
the
question
he
had
asked
himself
and
told
him
that
the
bones
of
a
very
young
child
had
been
found
as
well
as
those
of
a
young
woman
.
This
was
not
a
shock
.
How
could
it
be
otherwise
,
since
this
was
Wyvis
Hall
and
the
pine
wood
and
the
animal
cemetery
?
To
photograph
the
house
for
the
news
last
night
the
cameraman
must
have
stood
just
where
he
had
stood
himself
,
on
the
edge
of
the
lawn
with
his
back
to
the
cedar
tree
.
A
popular
.
mass-produced
camera
he
had
used
,
but
quite
a
good
one
.
One
thing
about
Zosie
's
pilfering
,
she
never
stole
rubbish
.
He
had
taken
a
picture
of
her
after
that
and
one
of
the
animal
cemetery
.
"
Why
is
the
grass
always
so
short
up
here
?
"
Adam
had
asked
.
"
Rabbits
,
I
expect
.
"
"
Why
ca
n't
bloody
rabbits
come
and
eat
my
lawns
?
"
Adam
always
referred
to
"
my
lawns
"
,
"
my
house
"
,
"
my
furniture
"
.
It
had
got
up
Rufus
's
nose
a
bit
,
though
Adam
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
this
.
It
was
his
,
all
of
it
,
and
it
went
to
his
head
rather
.
Nineteen-year-olds
seldom
inherit
country
mansions
,
after
all
.
It
must
have
been
some
time
in
August
when
I
took
those
pictures
,
Rufus
thought
,
and
a
couple
of
weeks
later
it
was
all
over
.
Coincidentally
,
as
the
community
and
their
lives
together
broke
up
,
so
did
the
weather
.
It
was
raining
intermittently
all
the
time
they
were
in
the
cemetery
,
the
pines
bowing
and
shivering
in
the
wind
.
Sometimes
they
had
had
to
stop
and
take
shelter
under
the
closely
planted-trees
.
If
the
weather
had
held
and
still
been
hot
and
dry
would
they
have
dug
deeper
?
Probably
not
.
In
spite
of
the
rain
,
the
earth
was
still
as
hard
as
iron
.
A
sheet
of
rain
had
come
down
then
,
a
hard
,
gusty
shower
,
while
they
were
laying
the
squares
of
turf
back
in
place
,
and
Adam
had
said
something
about
the
rain
making
the
grass
grow
quickly
,
the
rain
being
on
their
side
.
"
We
should
all
go
our
separate
ways
as
soon
as
we
can
,
"
Rufus
had
said
.
"
We
should
pack
up
now
and
go
.
"
The
spade
and
the
fork
they
had
hung
up
among
the
other
tools
in
the
stables
.
They
had
packed
and
Adam
had
locked
up
the
house
.
At
some
point
Rufus
himself
had
taken
the
things
out
of
the
fridge
and
left
the
door
open
to
defrost
it
.
Adam
closed
the
front
door
and
stood
there
for
a
moment
as
if
he
could
not
wrench
himself
away
.
So
much
of
its
beauty
had
been
stripped
from
it
by
the
whipping
winds
.
And
by
the
neglect
of
the
long
hot
summer
.
A
sudden
gust
of
rain
dashed
against
the
red
bricks
that
were
already
stained
in
patches
by
water
.
The
house
that
when
he
first
saw
it
had
seemed
to
float
on
a
raft
of
golden
mist
,
now
lay
in
a
wilderness
,
amidst
ragged
grass
and
straggling
bushes
and
trees
dead
from
the
heat
.
Dirty
grey
clouds
tumbled
across
the
sky
above
the
slate
roof
,
now
the
only
thing
that
shone
,
glazed
with
rain
.
But
Rufus
admitted
to
himself
that
the
beauties
of
nature
and
architecture
had
never
meant
much
to
him
.
It
was
the
heat
and
sunshine
and
privacy
he
liked
.
And
now
he
longed
only
to
get
away
.
They
all
got
into
Goblander
and
he
drove
away
up
the
drift
,
Adam
next
to
him
,
the
others
in
the
back
.
The
drift
had
become
a
tunnel
of
overgrowth
that
dripped
water
on
to
the
roof
of
the
van
.
None
of
them
allowed
their
eyes
to
turn
towards
the
pine
wood
.
At
the
top
they
came
out
into
uncompromising
,
bright
grey
light
,
the
bleak
,
hedgeless
lane
,
the
flat
meadows
where
here
and
there
stunted
trees
squatted
like
old
men
in
cloaks
.
Adam
's
simile
,
not
his
,
thought
Rufus
with
a
grimace
.
No
one
asked
where
he
was
taking
them
.
No
one
spoke
.
Adam
had
Hilbert
's
old
golf-bag
stuck
between
his
legs
and
Rufus
guessed
the
gun
was
inside
it
.
They
must
have
gone
a
good
two
miles
before
they
met
another
car
.
Rufus
overtook
a
bus
going
to
Colchester
and
dropped
the
two
in
the
back
so
that
they
could
catch
it
.
He
took
Adam
on
to
Sudbury
for
him
to
catch
a
train
there
and
at
that
point
they
parted
.
Adam
got
down
from
Goblander
and
said
,
"
For
ever
and
for
ever
,
farewell
,
Rufus
.
"
Which
was
probably
a
quotation
from
something
,
though
Rufus
did
not
know
what
and
thought
fastidiously
that
it
was
in
bad
taste
,
histrionic
,
though
just
like
Adam
.
"
Take
care
,
"
said
Rufus
,
and
not
looking
back
any
more
than
he
had
done
when
they
returned
from
the
cemetery
,
drove
off
round
the
town
he
had
got
to
know
so
well
,
over
the
Stour
bridge
,
into
Essex
,
heading
for
Halstead
and
Dunmow
and
Ongar
and
London
.
He
never
had
seen
any
of
them
again
.
There
had
been
no
need
to
pretend
,
to
turn
aside
.
Briefly
,
starting
his
fifth
year
in
medical
school
something
over
thirteen
months
later
,
he
had
wondered
if
Shiva
Manjusri
would
be
one
of
the
incoming
freshmen
.
But
no
,
his
intuition
had
been
accurate
.
At
any
rate
Shiva
's
face
was
not
among
the
several
brown
faces
.
As
for
the
others
,
avoiding
them
had
presented
no
problems
.
Would
they
get
in
touch
with
him
now
?
No
contingency
plans
had
been
made
for
this
eventuality
.
So
long
as
there
was
no
hunt
for
a
missing
girl
they
had
felt
themselves
reasonably
safe
.
Their
minds
had
not
reached
out
to
the
terror
of
what
had
in
fact
happened
.
None
of
them
had
been
the
kind
of
people
who
could
have
imagined
devotion
to
a
pet
animal
or
according
to
it
funerary
rites
.
It
was
Shiva
who
had
proposed
the
site
.
They
had
congratulated
him
on
his
ingenuity
.
Ten
years
-
An
ovarian
cyst
,
nothing
to
get
upset
about
,
Rufus
told
Ms
Beauchamp
.
She
was
thirty-two
,
an
editor
with
a
distinguished
publishing
house
,
married
to
an
investigative
journalist
.
As
yet
they
had
no
children
,
but
she
wanted
four
,
she
told
Rufus
.
"
No
reason
why
you
should
n't
.
"
He
had
another
glance
at
her
notes
.
"
In
fact
,
a
peculiarity
about
this
condition
is
that
it
seldom
if
ever
occurs
in
a
woman
who
's
had
a
baby
.
"
"
My
God
,
"
she
said
,
putting
her
coat
on
,
.
'and
there
was
1
,
making
my
husband
's
life
a
misery
,
sure
I
'd
got
the
dreaded
C.
"
They
all
thought
they
'd
got
the
dreaded
C
,
poor
things
.
You
could
n't
blame
them
.
Rufus
took
her
£40
off
her
by
the
reception
desk
,
having
set
in
train
the
arrangements
by
which
she
would
be
admitted
to
a
fashionable
West
End
clinic
,
with
Rufus
,
her
surgery
and
her
hospitalization
ultimately
paid
for
by
some
provident
association
to
which
she
and
her
husband
subscribed
.
Rufus
shook
hands
.
He
walked
back
to
his
consulting
room
,
dying
for
a
cigarette
.
This
was
unlike
him
.
He
could
usually
get
through
quite
easily
until
after
lunch
.
He
thought
,
I
know
what
my
idea
of
heaven
would
be
,
if
by
heaven
we
mean
a
place
of
bliss
in
which
to
pass
eternity
:
a
sanctuary
where
one
might
chain-smoke
without
impairment
of
breathing
,
destruction
of
the
lungs
or
damage
to
the
heart
,
light
each
fresh
cigarette
from
the
glowing
butt
of
its
predecessor
,
and
drink
ice-free
but
hundred-proof
chilled
vodka
laced
with
two
drops
of
angostura
and
a
gill
of
newly
opened
Perrier
endlessly
,
with
increasing
euphoria
until
a
peak
of
joy
and
ease
was
reached
but
without
any
sub-sequent
nausea
or
pain
or
dehydration
or
oblivion
-
Sitting
alone
,
he
lit
his
cigarette
,
the
first
of
the
day
,
and
there
came
that
faint
swimming
in
the
head
,
a
tautening
of
the
gut
.
He
closed
his
eyes
.
If
it
comes
to
light
that
I
was
in
that
house
with
Adam
and
the
others
,
he
thought
with
cold
clarity
,
if
someone
tells
the
papers
,
or
the
police
and
thence
the
papers
,
that
I
was
there
during
the
summer
of
1976
,
living
there
,
it
will
be
all
up
with
me
.
I
will
lose
my
practice
and
my
reputation
and
everything
that
I
have
and
can
look
forward
to
,
if
not
my
liberty
.
And
without
the
rest
I
sha
n't
care
about
my
liberty
.
It
would
be
bad
enough
if
I
were
a
G
P
or
an
expert
in
some
other
branch
of
medicine
,
an
orthopaedic
surgeon
,
for
instance
,
or
an
ear
,
nose
and
throat
man
,
but
I
am
a
gynaecologist
,
and
it
is
the
bones
of
a
young
woman
and
a
baby
that
have
been
found
there
-
What
worried
woman
would
come
to
me
?
What
Mrs
Strawson
or
Ms
Beauchamp
?
What
GP
would
send
her
to
me
?
If
I
were
innocent
,
thought
Rufus
,
I
know
very
well
what
I
would
do
.
I
would
pick
up
the
phone
and
phone
my
solicitor
and
ask
to
come
and
see
him
and
get
his
advice
.
He
might
advise
me
to
make
a
statement
to
the
police
which
I
should
of
course
do
under
his
guidance
.
But
I
shall
not
do
this
because
I
am
not
innocent
.
I
shall
sit
here
and
wait
and
sweat
it
out
and
look
the
facts
in
the
face
,
trying
to
anticipate
the
worst
that
can
happen
.
When
he
said
he
did
not
know
the
date
of
Adam
's
return
,
Lewis
Verne-Smith
had
not
lied
to
the
police
.
It
would
have
been
very
unusual
for
him
to
have
known
a
fact
like
that
about
his
son
's
life
and
movements
.
If
not
exactly
estranged
,
they
were
not
close
.
Lewis
was
inclined
to
say
he
had
"
no
time
for
"
Adam
.
He
believed
his
son
disliked
him
and
this
he
thought
outrageous
.
Sometimes
he
thought
about
Adam
when
he
was
a
child
and
what
a
dear
little
boy
he
had
been
,
affectionate
and
not
troublesome
.
"
They
undergo
a
complete
change
when
they
grow
up
,
"
he
said
to
Beryl
.
"
Adam
,
for
instance
,
he
might
not
be
the
same
person
.
"
He
had
decided
to
find
out
when
Adam
was
coming
back
and
drive
to
Heathrow
and
meet
the
plane
.
Adam
lived
as
far
away
from
the
parental
home
as
was
possible
while
still
living
in
north
London
.
Without
saying
anything
to
his
wife
Lewis
drove
to
Muswell
Hill
and
checked
that
Adam
's
car
was
in
its
garage
.
It
was
.
This
meant
they
must
have
had
a
hired
car
to
take
them
to
the
airport
or
have
gone
by
tube
.
Adam
's
own
car
was
bigger
and
newer
than
Lewis
's
and
very
clean
and
well
polished
,
all
of
which
Lewis
disliked
.
An
obscure
feeling
that
he
ought
to
have
a
key
to
this
house
made
him
resentful
.
It
was
something
he
found
hard
to
understand
,
though
of
course
it
must
be
accepted
,
this
escape
of
children
from
the
parental
bonds
so
that
they
could
have
secrets
from
you
and
hiding
places
you
could
n't
penetrate
,
that
they
were
adults
and
possessed
houses
and
cars
which
you
had
no
hand
in
choosing
or
buying
,
that
they
could
lock
up
those
houses
as
they
locked
up
their
thoughts
.
He
made
his
way
round
the
side
of
the
house
,
peering
in
at
the
windows
,
noting
that
some
dishes
,
though
washed
,
had
been
left
on
the
draining
board
.
There
were
dead
flowers
in
a
vase
half-full
of
green
water
.
Lewis
held
simultaneously
two
opposing
views
of
his
son
,
one
that
he
was
a
feckless
,
idle
,
good-for-nothing
layabout
and
the
other
that
he
was
a
hard
,
ruthless
,
astute
and
already
well
off
businessman
.
When
the
former
view
of
Adam
predominated
Lewis
felt
easier
,
happier
,
more
justified
.
On
the
way
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
find
the
police
at
Adam
's
.
It
would
not
have
surprised
him
as
he
walked
clockwise
round
the
house
to
have
met
a
policeman
proceeding
widdershins
.
However
,
there
was
no
one
about
,
not
even
the
neighbours
.
Lewis
stood
on
the
front
lawn
,
looking
up
at
the
bedroom
windows
.
It
was
a
very
nice
house
,
bigger
than
Lewis
's
own
and
in
a
more
attractive
neighbourhood
,
a
neo-Georgian
,
double-fronted
,
detached
house
,
altogether
superior
to
the
kind
of
thing
most
married
men
of
twenty-nine
could
afford
to
live
in
.
Adam
could
afford
it
because
of
the
money
he
got
from
the
sale
of
Wyvis
Hall
and
later
from
the
sale
of
the
London
house
he
bought
with
the
money
from
the
sale
of
Wyvis
Hall
.
If
things
had
happened
differently
he
,
Lewis
,
would
be
living
in
a
house
like
this
or
in
a
flat
in
central
London
with
a
cottage
in
the
country
as
well
.
And
Adam
would
have
what
was
proper
for
someone
of
his
age
and
standing
in
the
world
,
a
terraced
cottage
in
North
Finchley
or
maybe
Crouch
End
,
the
first
rung
on
the
slow
ladder
of
upward
mobility
.
Lewis
thought
bitterly
that
as
it
was
,
the
only
possible
next
step
up
for
Adam
would
be
Highgate
village
-
He
drove
home
and
this
time
he
felt
able
to
phone
the
travel
agent
friend
of
Adam
's
without
fear
of
a
rebuff
.
And
the
man
was
very
pleasant
,
reminding
him
that
they
had
met
at
Adam
's
wedding
.
He
had
no
objection
to
telling
him
when
Adam
and
Anne
were
returning
:
next
Tuesday
on
the
Iberian
Airlines
flight
from
Tenerife
that
got
in
at
1.30
p.m
.
After
he
had
rung
off
Lewis
considered
informing
the
police
,
he
thought
this
might
be
his
duty
,
but
on
the
other
hand
he
did
not
want
the
police
actually
to
be
there
when
Adam
arrived
.
He
told
his
wife
(
and
himself
)
that
he
was
going
to
meet
Adam
in
order
to
break
the
news
gently
to
him
that
these
awful
discoveries
had
been
made
at
Wyvis
Hall
and
that
foul
play
might
have
taken
place
while
he
,
Adam
,
was
actually
its
owner
.
"
Are
n't
you
getting
things
out
of
proportion
?
"
said
Beryl
.
"
How
so
?
"
"
There
has
n't
been
anything
said
about
foul
play
yet
.
"
But
even
as
she
said
this
,
as
Lewis
,
rather
dramatically
,
told
her
,
the
Standard
was
on
the
streets
announcing
that
police
were
treating
the
case
as
murder
.
It
was
only
a
few
lines
,
it
was
tucked
away
,
all
very
low
key
,
but
the
word
murder
was
there
to
be
seen
and
read
.
As
he
set
off
for
the
airport
Lewis
remembered
that
he
had
told
Adam
from
the
first
that
only
trouble
could
come
from
a
person
of
his
youth
and
inexperience
inheriting
a
big
house
and
land
of
the
dimensions
of
Wyvis
Hall
.
And
he
was
right
,
for
trouble
had
come
,
if
rather
tardily
.
Ten
years
it
had
taken
,
more
than
ten
years
.
In
some
ways
it
seemed
longer
than
that
to
Lewis
and
in
others
only
yesterday
.
On
the
other
hand
,
he
could
not
remember
a
time
when
it
had
not
been
taken
for
granted
the
Hall
would
one
day
be
his
own
.
The
Verne-Smiths
were
minor
gentry
.
Lewis
's
grandfather
had
been
I
parson
in
a
Suffolk
village
,
with
nothing
but
his
stipend
to
live
on
,
the
father
of
seven
children
.
Two
of
them
had
died
young
,
one
of
Lewis
's
aunts
had
married
and
gone
to
America
,
the
other
two
had
remained
spinsters
,
living
as
many
unmarried
women
in
the
country
used
to
do
,
in
tiny
cottages
in
the
middle
of
a
village
,
busy
in
a
mouse-like
way
about
parochial
matters
,
having
no
youth
,
earning
nothing
,
buried
alive
.
The
remaining
brothers
,
his
father
and
his
Uncle
Hilbert
,
were
much
younger
.
His
father
also
took
holy
orders
while
Hilbert
,
practising
as
a
solicitor
in
Ipswich
,
took
care
of
himself
by
marrying
a
rich
woman
.
The
Berelands
were
wealthy
landowners
.
If
a
son
or
daughter
married
and
no
suitable
home
was
in
the
offing
,
a
house
would
be
made
available
.
Lilian
Bereland
brought
Wyvis
Hall
with
her
,
not
as
a
grace
and
favour
dwelling
to
revert
to
her
family
on
her
or
her
husband
's
death
but
hers
to
do
with
absolutely
as
she
liked
.
Of
course
,
in
her
father
's
estimation
,
it
was
not
much
of
a
house
,
a
warren
of
smallish
rooms
was
how
he
saw
it
,
and
set
in
a
damp
situation
on
the
side
of
a
river
valley
.
There
was
not
much
sale
for
that
kind
of
thing
at
the
time
of
Hilbert
's
marriage
.
The
parson
and
his
wife
and
children
used
to
go
there
for
their
holidays
.
Lewis
's
father
's
parish
was
on
the
outskirts
of
Manchester
and
the
vicarage
was
Victorian-Byzantine-Gothic
,
soot-blackened
yellow
bricks
with
the
pseudo-Romanesque
windows
picked
out
in
red
bricks
.
Black-leaved
ilexes
grew
in
the
churchyard
and
a
brassy
laburnum
had
flowers
on
it
for
one
week
out
of
the
year
.
Wyvis
Hall
was
the
most
beautiful
place
the
seven-year-old
Lewis
had
ever
seen
and
the
countryside
was
glorious
.
In
those
days
the
fields
were
still
small
and
surrounded
by
hedges
and
the
lanes
ran
deep
between
lush
banks
.
Wild
orchids
grew
in
the
fens
and
monk's-hood
and
hemp
agrimony
on
the
borders
of
the
little
streams
where
there
were
caddis-flies
and
water-boatmen
and
dragon-flies
in
gold
velvet
or
silver
armour
.
Clouded
Yellow
butterflies
abounded
and
Small
Coppers
and
Blues
and
once
the
little
boy
saw
a
Purple
Emperor
.
A
pair
of
spotted
woodpeckers
nested
in
what
was
known
as
the
Little
Wood
below
the
lake
and
when
the
nuts
were
ripe
on
the
copper
cob
trees
a
nuthatch
came
up
quite
close
to
the
house
.
That
house
!
How
differently
did
it
appear
to
him
from
the
Berelands
'
assessment
!
To
him
it
was
grand
and
spacious
.
In
the
drawing
room
a
pair
of
pink
marble
pillars
supported
the
embrasure
of
the
windows
.
The
staircase
curved
up
prettily
to
a
gallery
.
There
was
a
library
that
Uncle
Hilbert
used
as
his
study
and
,
even
more
awe-inspiring
,
a
gun-room
with.stuffed
animals
and
shot-guns
on
the
walls
.
But
the
interior
meant
less
-
though
it
was
not
always
to
be
so
-
than
the
grounds
,
the
lake
,
the
woods
.
The
place
took
on
a
magical
quality
for
Lewis
,
who
had
towards
it
something
of
that
feeling
of
the
Grand
Meaulnes
for
his
lost
domain
.
He
used
to
long
for
his
holidays
and
grow
deeply
depressed
when
they
drew
to
an
end
.
It
was
a
glorious
victory
when
he
managed
to
persuade
the
grown-ups
to
let
him
stay
on
after
his
parents
had
gone
back
to
Manchester
.
Aunt
Lilian
had
never
had
any
children
,
and
she
died
in
1960
when
she
was
only
fifty-five
.
Uncle
Hilbert
took
the
loss
of
his
wife
very
hard
and
the
only
company
he
seemed
to
want
was
Lewis
's
.
It
was
about
this
time
that
he
started
telling
Lewis
Wyvis
Hall
would
be
his
one
day
.
He
also
informed
Lewis
's
parents
,
who
got
into
the
habit
of
saying
things
like
,
"
when
all
this
is
yours
"
,
and
"
when
you
come
into
your
property
"
.
Uncle
Hilbert
,
however
,
was
only
just
sixty
,
very
hale
and
hearty
,
still
very
much
in
practice
as
a
solicitor
,
and
Lewis
could
not
imagine
stepping
into
his
shoes
,
nor
did
he
in
those
days
think
it
very
nice
to
anticipate
such
things
.
But
he
went
down
to
Suffolk
very
often
,
much
more
often
perhaps
than
he
would
have
done
had
Wyvis
Hall
been
destined
to
pass
back
to
the
Berelands
or
on
to
one
of
those
cousins
in
the
United
States
.
His
feeling
for
the
place
underwent
many
changes
.
In
the
nature
of
things
meadow
,
grove
and
stream
no
longer
appeared
to
him
apparelled
in
celestial
light
,
the
glory
and
the
freshness
of
a
dream
.
He
was
growing
up
.
He
began
to
see
the
grounds
as
a
possession
,
the
gardens
as
something
to
impress
others
,
the
orchard
and
walled
fruit-garden
as
places
that
would
produce
delicious
food
.
Although
he
intended
to
live
in
the
house
,
for
at
least
part
of
the
time
,
he
saw
it
too
as
saleable
and
the
value
or
price
of
it
(
however
you
liked
to
put
it
)
going
up
every
year
.
The
pines
in
the
wood
,
where
Uncle
Hilbert
's
hunt-terrier
Blaze
was
the
last
creature
laid
to
rest
,
he
saw
as
a
useful
and
lucrative
crop
.
He
noticed
the
pieces
with
which
Wyvis
Hall
was
furnished
,
taking
books
out
of
the
public
library
on
antiques
and
porcelain
and
measuring
the
remembered
articles
against
illustrations
,
catching
his
breath
sometimes
at
mounting
values
.
Another
thing
he
did
was
picture
himself
and
his
wife
in
the
drawing
room
receiving
dinner
guests
.
The
address
on
his
writing
paper
would
simply
be
:
Wyvis
Hall
,
Nunes-by-Ipswich
,
Suffolk
.
It
was
one
of
Lewis
's
ambitions
to
have
an
address
in
which
the
name
of
the
street
might
be
left
out
without
causing
inconvenience
to
the
post
office
.
The
house
and
grounds
were
marked
on
the
Ordnance
Survey
map
for
that
part
of
Suffolk
and
Lewis
,
when
he
was
feeling
low
,
would
get
it
out
and
look
at
it
to
cheer
himself
up
.
By
the
1960s
he
was
married
and
had
two
children
,
a
son
and
a
daughter
.
When
his
son
was
born
he
thought
it
would
be
nice
,
a
nice
gesture
,
to
name
him
after
Hilbert
.
"
An
old
family
name
,
"
he
told
his
wife
,
though
this
was
not
true
at
all
,
his
uncle
's
being
thus
christened
having
been
an
isolated
instance
of
the
use
of
Hilbert
.
There
had
been
a
fashion
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
for
Germanic
names
and
his
uncle
,
born
in
1902
,
had
caught
the
tail
end
of
it
.
"
I
do
n't
like
that
at
all
,
"
his
wife
had
said
.
"
People
will
think
it
's
really
Gilbert
or
Albert
.
I
do
n't
want
him
teased
,
poor
baby
.
"
"
He
will
be
called
by
his
surname
at
his
public
school
,
"
said
Lewis
,
who
though
poor
had
grand
ideas
,
as
befitted
the
future
owner
of
Wyvis
Hall
and
its
acres
.
So
he
won
,
or
appeared
to
win
,
that
battle
and
the
child
was
christened
Hilbert
John
Adam
.
Lewis
had
written
to
Uncle
Hilbert
and
told
him
of
his
intention
to
name
his
son
after
him
,
inviting
him
to
be
the
child
's
godfather
.
Declining
on
the
grounds
that
he
no
longer
had
any
religious
faith
,
Uncle
Hilbert
sent
a
silver
christening
mug
,
large
enough
to
hold
a
pint
of
beer
.
But
the
note
that
accompanied
it
made
no
mention
of
the
choice
of
name
and
it
was
rather
a
cold
note
.
Later
on
,
when
Lewis
and
his
wife
and
the
baby
went
to
stay
at
Wyvis
Hall
,
Hilbert
's
only
comment
on
his
great-nephew
's
name
was
:
"
Poor
little
devil
.
"
By
then
,
anyway
,
the
baby
was
always
called
Adam
by
everyone
.
Lewis
,
who
was
no
fool
,
soon
saw
that
in
some
incomprehensible
way
he
had
put
his
uncle
's
back
up
.
He
set
about
rectifying
matters
,
attempting
to
redress
the
balance
.
His
uncle
's
birthday
was
noted
,
he
must
always
have
a
Christmas
present
bought
and
sent
in
good
time
.
He
was
invited
to
London
and
all
sorts
of
treats
were
held
out
to
him
as
to
how
he
would
be
entertained
on
such
a
visit
,
trips
to
the
theatre
and
concerts
,
a
specially
organized
tour
of
"
Swinging
London
"
,
Carnaby
Street
,
the
King
's
Road
and
so
on
.
Lewis
knew
very
well
he
should
not
do
this
,
that
he
was
sucking
up
to
someone
for
the
sake
of
inheriting
his
property
.
But
he
could
not
help
himself
,
he
could
not
do
otherwise
.
Of
course
he
continued
to
take
his
family
to
Wyvis
Hall
regularly
for
their
summer
holidays
.
He
had
a
daughter
as
well
now
whom
he
had
been
tempted
to
call
Lilian
but
had
seen
the
unwisdom
of
this
in
time
and
named
her
Bridget
.
His
wife
would
have
liked
to
go
to
Cornwall
sometimes
or
even
to
Majorca
but
Lewis
said
it
was
out
of
the
question
,
they
could
n't
afford
it
.
Perhaps
what
he
really
meant
was
that
they
could
n't
afford
not
to
go
to
Nunes
.
By
1970
you
could
n't
buy
a
derelict
cottage
in
the
Nunes
neighbourhood
for
less
than
,
4,000
and
Wyvis
Hall
would
fetch
five
times
that
.
One
day
,
soon
after
he
had
retired
from
his
legal
practice
,
Hilbert
told
Lewis
he
had
made
a
will
that
was
"
very
much
to
your
advantage
"
.
He
smiled
in
a
benevolent
sort
of
way
when
he
said
this
.
They
were
sitting
out
on
the
terrace
on
the
low
wall
of
which
stood
,
in
pairs
,
stone
figures
from
classical
mythology
of
a
rather
embarrassing
kind
.
Under
the
drawing-room
window
agapanthus
africanus
,
the
blue
lily
,
was
in
full
flower
.
Hilbert
and
Lewis
and
Beryl
sat
in
old-fashioned
deck
chairs
with
striped
canvas
seats
.
Hilbert
leant
towards
Lewis
when
he
told
him
about
the
will
and
gave
him
a
pat
on
the
knee
.
Lewis
said
something
about
being
very
grateful
.
"
I
finally
made
up
my
mind
when
you
named
the
boy
after
me
,
"
said
Hilbert
.
Lewis
said
more
grateful
things
and
about
naming
his
son
Hilbert
being
only
proper
and
suitable
under
the
circumstances
.
"
In
the
circumstances
,
"
said
Hilbert
.
He
was
in
the
habit
of
correcting
minor
errors
of
grammar
or
usage
.
Adam
must
have
got
it
from
him
,
Lewis
sometimes
thought
,
or
perhaps
(
he
much
later
and
very
bitterly
thought
)
a
similar
pedantry
in
Adam
was
among
the
things
Hilbert
liked
about
him
.
Lewis
did
not
like
being
corrected
but
he
had
to
take
it
,
and
with
a
smile
.
It
would
n't
go
on
for
ever
.
The
Verne-Smiths
were
not
long
livers
.
Lewis
's
father
had
died
at
sixty
and
his
grandfather
at
sixty-two
.
His
three
aunts
were
all
dead
at
under
seventy
.
Hilbert
would
be
seventy
the
following
year
and
Lewis
said
to
his
wife
that
his
uncle
was
beginning
to
look
very
frail
.
He
began
"
running
down
"
to
Suffolk
at
weekends
on
his
own
,
and
that
Christmas
he
had
his
wife
accompany
him
for
four
days
,
taking
all
the
Christmas
food
with
them
.
The
woman
who
came
in
to
clean
and
the
old
boy
who
saw
to
the
garden
had
been
instructed
to
call
him
"
Mr
"
Lewis
and
he
felt
very
much
the
heir
.
His
uncle
had
n't
much
money
,
he
supposed
,
but
there
would
be
a
little
,
enough
to
put
central
heating
in
,
say
,
and
have
the
place
redecorated
.
Lewis
had
n't
made
up
his
mind
whether
to
sell
Wyvis
Hall
after
he
had
smartened
it
up
a
bit
and
with
the
proceeds
buy
a
bigger
and
better
London
house
and
a
country
cottage
or
to
keep
the
Hall
and
sell
off
some
of
the
land
for
agriculture
.
According
to
his
estimate
,
the
result
of
perusing
estate
agents
'
windows
in
Ipswich
and
Sudbury
,
Wyvis
Hall
by
the
end
of
1972
was
worth
about
£23,000
.
It
was
a
continual
source
of
irritation
to
Lewis
that
Adam
did
not
show
more
respect
and
deference
to
Hilbert
.
The
boy
was
offhand
and
always
trying
to
be
clever
.
He
called
his
great-uncle
by
his
christian
name
with
no
prefix
and
did
not
jump
to
his
feet
when
the
old
man
entered
the
room
.
Lewis
pressed
Adam
to
accompany
him
on
those
solicitous
weekend
visits
but
Adam
nearly
always
said
he
was
too
busy
or
would
be
bored
.
There
had
in
fact
only
been
one
occasion
during
those
last
years
that
Lewis
could
remember
and
he
was
sure
Adam
had
only
gone
because
there
had
been
a
promise
of
some
shooting
.
The
visit
had
been
far
from
successful
,
for
Adam
had
sulked
when
offered
the
four-ten
,
the
so-called
"
lady
's
gun
"
.
Sometimes
,
since
then
,
Lewis
had
wondered
what
would
have
happened
if
Adam
had
obeyed
him
and
been
kind
and
polite
to
the
perverse
old
man
.
Would
Hilbert
have
left
his
property
to
Bridget
perhaps
,
or
even
to
the
Law
Society
?
It
was
to
be
three
more
years
before
his
uncle
died
,
thus
becoming
the
longest-lived
Verne-Smith
that
anyone
had
heard
of
.
The
daily
woman
found
him
dead
one
morning
in
the
April
of
1976
.
He
was
lying
on
the
floor
outside
his
bedroom
at
the
top
of
the
back
stairs
.
The
cause
of
death
was
a
cerebral
haemorrhage
.
Adam
was
nineteen
and
in
his
first
year
at
university
,
though
at
that
time
at
home
for
the
Easter
break
.
After
the
cremation
,
while
the
few
mourners
were
looking
gloomily
at
the
flowers
,
his
uncle
's
solicitor
,
a
partner
in
the
Ipswich
practice
,
spoke
to
Lewis
simply
to
say
that
he
believed
he
already
knew
the
contents
of
the
will
.
Secure
as
he
thought
in
possession
,
Lewis
brushed
this
aside
as
being
an
unsuitable
subject
for
discussion
at
such
a
time
.
The
solicitor
nodded
and
went
on
his
way
.
A
week
later
Adam
got
a
letter
saying
he
was
the
sole
beneficiary
under
the
will
of
his
late
great-uncle
.
There
was
no
money
,
Hilbert
having
used
all
he
possessed
to
purchase
himself
an
annuity
,
but
Wyvis
Hall
and
its
contents
were
Adam
's
absolutely
.
There
were
traffic
jams
all
along
the
North
Circular
Road
,
a
particularly
long
one
at
Stonebridge
Park
and
another
at
Hanger
Lane
.
Lewis
,
sensibly
,
had
allowed
himself
a
lot
of
time
.
Adam
would
be
very
surprised
to
see
him
.
He
would
probably
think
something
had
happened
to
his
mother
and
that
Lewis
was
there
as
the
bearer
of
bad
news
.
Of
course
in
a
way
he
was
,
though
not
of
that
kind
.
For
a
moment
or
two
,
as
he
waited
in
the
queue
behind
a
container-truck
full
of
German
furniture
and
a
self-drive
hire
removal
van
,
Lewis
returned
to
speculating
as
to
how
and
why
those
bones
had
got
into
the
animal
cemetery
.
Frankly
,
he
did
not
suppose
Adam
had
had
anything
directly
to
do
with
this
at
all
.
What
seemed
likely
to
him
was
that
Adam
had
allowed
some
undesirable
person
or
persons
access
to
the
place
and
it
was
these
vagrants
or
hippies
-
there
had
been
a
lot
of
hippies
still
about
then
-
were
responsible
.
Adam
himself
had
never
shown
any
interest
in
Wyvis
Hall
,
as
far
as
he
had
noticed
.
That
was
part
of
the
unfairness
of
it
.
He
had
seen
this
unlooked-for
inheritance
simply
as
a
source
of
lucre
.
When
the
letter
came
Lewis
had
nearly
opened
it
himself
.
The
postmark
and
the
old-fashioned
and
precise
direction
(
Esquire
and
the
name
of
the
house
as
well
as
the
street
number
)
told
him
it
was
from
Hilbert
's
old
firm
.
And
he
thought
he
knew
what
had
happened
.
They
had
made
a
mistake
,
that
was
all
,
and
sent
it
to
his
son
.
Or
else
it
might
be
that
Hilbert
had
left
Adam
some
small
memento
or
keepsake
-
Adam
was
lying
late
in
bed
.
Lewis
would
never
forget
that
if
he
forgot
all
the
rest
.
And
he
,
for
his
part
,
was
feeling
so
euphoric
that
instead
of
shouting
to
his
son
to
get
up
and
stir
his
stumps
,
he
had
actually
gone
in
there
and
put
the
envelope
on
Adam
's
bedside
table
.
The
awful
thing
was
that
all
this
time
Lewis
had
never
had
any
doubts
he
was
himself
the
new
owner
of
Wyvis
Hall
.
It
must
have
been
a
Saturday
or
else
Lewis
for
some
reason
or
other
was
on
holiday
from
work
.
Anyway
he
was
at
home
that
day
,
home
for
lunch
,
and
he
and
Beryl
were
actually
sitting
at
the
table
,
talking
as
it
happened
about
going
down
soon
to
take
a
look
at
the
Hall
,
when
Adam
came
in
.
He
had
very
long
hair
at
the
time
and
a
beard
,
Lewis
remembered
,
and
looked
as
they
all
did
like
some
kind
of
weird
prophet
.
To
this
day
Lewis
had
a
picture
in
his
mind
of
how
his
son
had
looked
walking
into
the
dining
room
(
or
dining
area
of
the
living
room
really
)
wearing
jeans
of
course
,
jeans
with
ragged
hems
,
and
a
collarless
tunic
garment
,
tie-dyed
with
coloured
inks
.
Afterwards
Lewis
wished
he
had
said
something
scathing
,
alluding
perhaps
to
the
lateness
of
the
hour
or
Adam
's
appearance
.
Well
,
he
had
alluded
to
Adam
's
appearance
but
in
a
genial
way
.
He
had
been
feeling
cheerful
,
God
help
him
!
"
Just
in
time
for
the
locusts
and
honey
!
"
.
Adam
said
,
"
Something
rather
fantastic
;
old
Hilbert
's
left
me
his
house
.
"
"
Yes
,
very
funny
,
"
Lewis
had
said
.
"
What
has
he
left
you
?
His
desk
?
You
always
said
you
liked
that
.
"
"
No
kidding
,
he
's
left
me
his
house
.
Whatsitsname
Hall
.
Unbelievable
,
is
n't
it
?
It
was
quite
a
shock
.
You
can
see
the
letter
if
you
like
.
"
Lewis
snatched
the
letter
.
He
had
begun
to
tremble
.
There
it
was
in
black
and
white
:
"
-
the
property
known
as
Wyvis
Hall
at
Nunes
in
the
county
of
Suffolk
,
the
lands
pertaining
thereto
-
"
but
it
must
be
a
mistake
.
"
They
've
mistaken
you
for
me
,
my
boy
,
"
Lewis
said
grimly
.
Adam
smiled
.
"
I
doubt
that
.
"
"
You
doubt
it
?
You
know
nothing
about
it
.
Of
course
Wyvis
Hall
is
mine
,
it
's
always
been
a
matter
of
fact
it
would
be
mine
.
This
is
a
simple
mix-up
,
a
confusion
of
names
,
though
I
must
say
it
amounts
to
criminal
carelessness
.
"
"
You
could
phone
them
,
"
said
Beryl
.
"
I
shall
.
I
shall
phone
them
immediately
I
've
finished
my
lunch
.
"
But
he
was
not
able
to
finish
his
lunch
.
He
could
n't
eat
another
mouthful
.
Adam
ate
.
He
ate
his
way
through
bread
and
butter
and
ham
and
pickles
and
drank
a
half-pint
of
milk
.
Lewis
went
out
into
the
hall
and
phoned
Hilbert
's
solicitors
.
The
one
he
wanted
was
still
out
at
lunch
.
Adam
got
up
from
the
table
and
said
he
thought
he
might
go
over
to
Rufus
's
.
"
You
're
not
going
anywhere
,
"
said
Lewis
.
"
I
forbid
you
to
leave
this
house
.
"
"
You
what
?
"
said
Adam
,
looking
at
him
and
grinning
.
Beryl
said
,
"
Just
wait
a
few
minutes
,
Adam
,
till
we
've
got
this
cleared
up
.
"
"
Why
's
he
getting
his
knickers
in
a
twist
anyway
if
he
's
so
sure
it
's
a
mistake
?
"
It
was
not
then
but
ten
minutes
afterwards
,
when
he
had
spoken
to
the
solicitor
and
been
assured
there
was
no
mistake
,
that
Lewis
began
to
dislike
his
son
.
Adam
said
:
"
You
ca
n't
expect
me
to
be
sorry
he
left
the
place
to
me
and
not
to
you
.
Obviously
,
I
think
he
made
the
right
decision
.
"
"
Ca
n't
you
see
what
an
outrage
it
is
?
"
Adam
was
excited
.
He
wanted
to
go
and
tell
the
Fletcher
family
his
good
fortune
.
Lewis
was
boiling
with
rage
and
misery
and
shock
.
"
Can
I
have
the
car
?
"
said
Adam
.
"
No
,
you
ca
n't
!
Now
or
at
any
other
time
,
and
that
's
final
!
"
Lewis
soon
formulated
a
plan
whereby
they
could
all
share
Wyvis
Hall
.
It
was
not
ideal
,
it
was
not
what
he
had
anticipated
,
far
from
it
,
but
it
was
better
than
abandoning
it
to
Adam
.
After
all
,
Adam
would
be
back
at
college
in
a
week
's
time
,
the
will
would
have
to
be
proved
,
but
by
the
middle
of
the
summer
why
should
n't
he
and
his
wife
and
Bridget
use
the
Hall
regularly
at
weekends
?
Adam
could
have
it
for
his
long
vacation
.
He
,
Lewis
,
was
quite
prepared
to
get
the
place
redecorated
at
his
own
expense
.
It
was
a
family
house
after
all
,
no
doubt
Hilbert
had
intended
Adam
to
share
it
with
the
rest
of
the
family
.
He
and
Beryl
and
Bridget
could
go
there
at
the
weekends
and
they
could
all
be
there
together
for
Christmas
.
What
did
a
boy
still
at
university
,
with
no
prospects
yet
of
any
sort
of
career
,
what
did
someone
like
that
want
with
a
massive
country
house
?
"
I
want
to
sell
it
,
"
Adam
said
.
"
I
want
the
money
.
"
"
Sell
the
land
,
"
said
Lewis
.
"
I
do
n't
want
to
sell
the
land
.
It
would
n't
fetch
much
anyway
,
agricultural
land
.
And
who
's
going
to
want
to
buy
it
?
"
It
was
plain
that
Adam
had
gone
into
this
aspect
of
things
.
"
No
,
since
you
ask
-
"
Clearly
,
Adam
was
only
reluctantly
willing
to
share
his
plans
with
his
parents
,
"
Since
you
ask
,
I
'm
going
to
go
down
and
take
a
look
at
it
as
soon
as
I
can
and
then
I
'm
going
to
put
it
on
the
market
.
"
Adam
returned
to
college
.
That
summer
Lewis
thought
perhaps
he
was
on
the
verge
of
a
nervous
breakdown
.
He
made
all
sorts
of
wild
plans
.
He
would
go
down
to
Nunes
and
take
over
the
house
.
If
necessary
he
would
break
in
and
take
possession
.
The
village
people
would
support
his
cause
-
did
n't
they
call
him
Mr
Lewis
?
Was
n't
he
the
rightful
heir
?
Adam
would
never
try
to
regain
the
house
by
force
.
By
this
time
his
fantasies
took
on
the
air
of
medieval
barons
'
wars
.
He
actually
dreamed
of
himself
in
a
suit
of
armour
opening
the
big
,
oak
front
door
with
a
mace
in
his
hand
and
Adam
riding
up
on
a
black
,
colourfully
caparisoned
horse
.
More
practically
,
he
consulted
solicitors
of
his
own
in
an
attempt
to
have
the
will
disputed
.
They
advised
him
against
trying
.
He
had
another
go
at
persuasion
and
wrote
Adam
long
letters
to
his
college
begging
for
compromises
.
Adam
phoned
home
and
asked
his
mother
to
stop
his
father
bothering
him
when
he
was
in
the
middle
of
exams
.
Lewis
's
doctor
put
him
on
tranquillizers
and
advised
him
to
go
away
on
holiday
.
In
the
middle
of
June
he
suddenly
gave
up
.
He
washed
his
hands
of
Adam
and
Wyvis
Hall
and
the
memory
of
his
Uncle
Hilbert
.
The
whole
thing
disgusted
him
,
he
told
Beryl
,
it
was
beneath
his
notice
,
only
he
could
n't
help
feeling
utterly
disillusioned
with
human
nature
.
He
would
n't
go
to
Wyvis
Hall
now
if
Adam
invited
him
,
if
he
went
down
on
his
bended
knees
.
His
exams
over
,
Adam
came
home
.
He
slept
one
night
at
home
and
then
went
down
to
Nunes
,
taking
Rufus
Fletcher
with
him
.
Or
,
rather
,
being
taken
by
Rufus
in
whose
van
they
went
.
Lewis
refused
to
show
any
interest
.
He
practically
ignored
Adam
for
whom
he
now
felt
a
deep
,
distasteful
antipathy
.
A
few
months
before
,
if
anyone
had
told
him
you
could
feel
dislike
for
your
own
child
,
a
real
aversion
from
your
own
flesh
and
blood
,
he
would
not
have
believed
them
.
But
that
was
how
he
felt
.
He
could
n't
get
Adam
out
of
the
house
fast
enough
.
Two
days
later
he
was
back
.
So
much
for
Wyvis
Hall
.
That
was
how
much
Adam
appreciated
the
beautiful
old
house
he
had
had
the
unheard-of
good
fortune
to
inherit
at
the
age
of
nineteen
.
He
was
going
to
Greece
with
Rufus
Fletcher
and
Rufus
Fletcher
's
girlfriend
who
was
an
Honourable
,
the
daughter
of
some
titled
person
.
"
You
would
think
someone
with
her
background
would
know
better
,
"
said
Lewis
.
"
Know
better

said
Adam
.
"
Well

single
girl

places

that

Adam
laughed
.
"

said
Beryl
.
"

never

Lewis
had
forgotten
to
be
indifferent
and
aloof
,
he
could
n't
help
it
.
"
And
what
about
that
beautiful
old
house
you
've
been
unaccountably
made
responsible
for
?
What
about
that
?
Is
that
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
rack
and
ruin
?
"
"
It
's
not
in
ruins

"
said
Adam
,
looking
him
in
the
eye
.
"
I
do
n't
know
what
rack
means
.
I
've
got
someone
from
the
village
coming
in
every
day
to
check
that
no
one
tries
making
a
nuisance
of
themselves
.
Squatters
,
I
mean
.
There
's
a
lot
of
squatting
going
on
.
"
Lewis
had
known
what
he
meant
.
He
knew
who
Adam
thought
the
squatters
might
be
.
It
was
a
terrible
way
to
speak
to
your
own
father
.
Up
in
the
short-term
car-park
at
Terminal
Two
,
Lewis
had
to
drive
from
floor
to
floor
before
he
found
a
slot
in
which
to
put
the
car
.
He
was
back
in
the
present
now
,
having
exhausted
those
resentful
memories
.
Adam
had
gone
to
Greece
the
next
day
and
not
reappeared
until
September
.
Lewis
and
Beryl
,
of
course
,
had
never
gone
near
Wyvis
Hall
,
they
would
not
have
laid
themselves
open
to
such
humiliation
,
to
the
possibility
of
their
way
being
barred
by
some
yokel
,
paid
by
Adam
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
place
.
Where
had
Adam
got
the
money
to
pay
someone
to
look
in
at
Wyvis
Hall
daily
?
Lewis
asked
himself
this
question
as
he
went
down
in
the
lift
and
crossed
the
arrivals
hall
of
Terminal
Two
to
await
the
exodus
from
Customs
.
The
flight
from
Tenerife
was
due
in
fifteen
minutes
and
he
saw
that
there
was
a
screen
on
the
wall
that
would
show
when
it
landed
.
People
stood
about
meeting
planes
,
men
who
seemed
to
be
the
drivers
of
hired
cars
carrying
placards
with
the
names
of
people
or
companies
printed
on
them
,
families
waiting
for
a
returning
father
,
a
strange
old
woman
in
a
red
cloak
,
chewing
gum
.
Lewis
wondered
what
visitor
from
Rome
or
Amsterdam
or
the
Canaries
was
going
to
have
the
misfortune
to
stay
with
her
.
Perhaps
he
should
have
told
the
police
that
there
had
been
someone
going
into
Wyvis
Hall
every
day
during
those
months
of
summer
.
Certainly
it
would
not
have
been
a
respectable
person
,
such
as
Hilbert
's
gardener
or
cleaner
,
but
most
likely
some
unemployed
derelict
Adam
had
met
in
a
pub
.
This
person
might
easily
be
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
that
led
to
that
appalling
interment
.
And
by
association
Adam
would
be
involved
in
it
too
.
There
did
not
appear
to
be
any
police
in
the
crowd
.
No
policemen
had
been
sent
to
intercept
Adam
,
unless
of
course
they
were
in
plain
clothes
-
those
two
that
looked
like
businessmen
,
for
instance
.
They
were
probably
detectives
.
Who
else
would
be
waiting
at
the
arrival
barrier
at
Heathrow
at
this
hour
?
Lewis
began
to
feel
excited
.
Suppose
Adam
were
to
be
arrested
before
he
even
reached
his
father
?
He
imagined
himself
driving
a
tearful
Anne
and
Abigail
back
to
Beryl
,
then
finding
Adam
a
good
lawyer
.
Adam
would
have
to
admit
he
had
been
in
the
wrong
,
had
been
extremely
negligent
,
criminally
careless
really
,
in
allowing
any
Tom
,
Dick
and
Harry
access
to
Wyvis
Hall
.
He
might
not
wish
to
reveal
names
to
the
police
but
he
would
have
to
.
Pressure
would
be
put
on
him
.
Eventually
,
he
would
come
to
confess
that
if
his
father
had
inherited
the
Hall
as
he
had
rightfully
expected
to
do
,
none
of
this
would
have
happened
.
The
arrival
of
flight
IB
640
from
Tenerife
came
up
on
the
screen
.
By
this
time
Lewis
was
off
into
a
fantasy
in
which
a
girl
Adam
had
got
pregnant
had
been
abandoned
by
him
with
their
child
at
Wyvis
Hall
where
she
had
later
been
murdered
by
a
sinister
caretaker
.
The
first
arrivals
were
coming
out
of
Customs
now
:
two
middle-aged
couples
,
a
crowd
of
kids
who
looked
like
students
,
a
family
with
four
children
and
grandma
,
a
man
who
looked
as
if
he
had
been
drinking
on
the
plane
,
his
collar
undone
and
his
tie
hanging
.
The
detectives
who
were
not
detectives
after
all
stepped
forward
to
meet
him
,
one
of
them
shaking
hands
,
the
other
slapping
him
on
the
back
.
A
woman
came
out
wheeling
a
big
tartan
case
and
behind
her
was
Adam
,
pushing
cases
on
a
trolley
,
Anne
beside
him
looking
brown
and
tired
,
pushing
the
empty
pushchair
,
with
Abigail
asleep
on
her
shoulder
.
Adam
's
face
,
when
he
saw
his
father
,
was
a
study
in
some
unpleasant
emotion
,
not
so
much
anxiety
as
exasperation
.
The
wonderful
thing
about
the
human
mind
,
Adam
thought
,
is
the
way
it
copes
when
the
worst
happens
.
Beyond
that
worst
happening
you
think
there
can
be
nothing
,
the
unimaginable
has
taken
place
,
and
on
the
other
side
is
death
,
destruction
,
the
end
.
But
the
worst
happens
and
you
reel
from
it
,
you
stagger
,
the
shock
is
enormous
,
and
then
you
begin
to
recover
.
You
rally
,
you
stand
up
and
face
it
.
You
get
used
to
it
.
An
hour
maybe
and
you
are
making
contingency
plans
.
For
what
had
happened
was
not
the
worst
,
you
realized
that
.
The
worst
was
yet
to
come
,
was
perhaps
always
yet
to
come
,
never
would
actually
come
,
because
if
it
did
you
would
know
it
,
that
would
be
reality
,
and
there
would
be
nothing
then
but
to
kill
yourself
.
Quickly
.
Now
that
he
was
able
to
,
he
assembled
what
had
happened
and
laid
the
facts
before
himself
.
They
had
dug
up
those
bones
at
Wyvis
Hall
and
had
decided
it
was
murder
they
were
investigating
.
Bones
,
skeletons
,
bodies
,
do
not
bury
themselves
.
Those
were
the
facts
,
as
far
as
he
knew
them
up
to
this
moment
.
He
would
know
more
,
much
more
,
in
the
days
to
come
.
What
was
certain
was
that
he
could
no
longer
use
the
escape
key
.
It
was
defunct
.
The
passages
it
cancelled
had
,
in
any
case
,
as
in
certain
programmes
,
not
been
lost
but
stored
on
some
limbo
disc
from
whence
they
must
now
be
retrieved
.
Adam
sat
in
his
parents
'
house
,
drinking
tea
.
There
must
be
a
total
retrieval
now
,
the
one
good
thing
about
which
was
that
it
might
banish
his
dreams
.
He
was
aware
of
a
slight
feeling
of
sickness
and
of
cold
,
an
absence
of
hunger
,
though
he
had
been
feeling
quite
hungry
when
he
got
off
the
plane
.
Anne
sat
next
to
him
on
his
mother
's
cretonne-covered
settee
and
Abigail
lay
on
a
plaid
rug
on
the
floor
,
kicking
with
her
legs
and
punching
with
her
arms
.
His
mother
kept
poking
toys
which
she
did
not
want
at
her
.
A
passage
from
a
novel
by
John
O'Hara
came
back
to
Adam
.
He
had
memorized
it
years
ago
in
the
Ecalpemos
epoch
:
"
The
safest
way
to
live
is
first
,
inherit
money
,
second
,
be
born
without
taste
for
liquor
,
third
,
have
a
legitimate
job
that
keeps
you
busy
,
fourth
,
marry
a
wife
who
will
cooperate
in
your
sexual
peculiarities
,
fifth
,
join
some
big
church
,
sixth
,
do
n't
live
too
long
.
"
Apart
from
the
last
one
which
he
had
n't
got
to
yet
and
the
penultimate
one
which
seemed
to
apply
in
America
more
than
here
(
here
he
had
joined
the
golf
club
)
he
had
complied
with
all
the
rest
.
Or
his
nature
and
luck
had
complied
for
him
.
Nemesis
had
still
come
down
like
the
wolf
on
the
fold
.
He
had
not
wanted
to
come
back
here
.
But
there
had
been
no
spirit
in
him
,
the
shock
of
what
his
father
told
him
had
been
too
great
.
"
Something
that
will
interest
you
,
Adam
,
something
to
make
you
sit
up
.
They
've
dug
up
a
lot
of
human
bones
at
my
old
uncle
's
house
-
"
By
the
time
he
had
rallied
and
got
himself
together
and
was
thinking
of
things
to
say
to
the
police
it
was
too
late
and
they
were
heading
north
.
Anne
was
furious
.
When
Lewis
said
to
come
back
with
him
and
eat
there
Adam
had
got
a
kick
on
the
ankle
from
Anne
and
another
kick
when
he
had
n't
replied
.
He
had
turned
on
her
and
said
with
cold
savagery
,
"
For
fuck
's
sake
,
stop
kicking
me
,
will
you
?
"
He
expected
his
father
to
rise
and
say
something
about
that
being
no
way
to
speak
to
one
's
wife
or
not
in
front
of
the
child
,
he
was
capable
of
that
.
But
he
had
said
nothing
,
only
looked
subdued
,
and
Adam
realized
why
.
His
own
terrible
fear
and
anger
had
communicated
itself
to
his
father
and
shown
him
what
the
better
part
of
valour
was
:
keeping
silent
.
Having
put
the
cat
among
the
pigeons
,
made
mischief
in
his
special
way
,
he
was
lying
low
now
and
waiting
.
The
old
bastard
.
Adam
only
wished
Uncle
Hilbert
had
left
him
Wyvis
Hall
and
then
there
would
have
been
no
Ecalpemos
,
no
Zosie
,
and
no
deaths
.
And
Adam
could
n't
see
he
would
have
been
much
worse
off
.
He
and
Anne
would
be
living
in
a
house
like
this
one
,
rather
than
that
neo-Georgian
palace
.
Children
,
after
all
,
he
thought
,
looking
at
Abigail
,
were
happy
wherever
they
were
,
so
long
as
they
were
loved
-
His
parents
had
not
asked
him
what
sort
of
holiday
he
had
had
or
how
the
flight
had
been
.
The
conversation
was
exclusively
on
the
subject
of
the
discovery
at
Wyvis
Hall
.
Adam
did
not
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
he
had
not
obtained
an
English
newspaper
while
away
.
If
he
had
done
the
shock
would
have
been
less
but
on
the
other
hand
,
his
holiday
would
have
been
spoilt
.
He
would
have
liked
very
much
to
be
alone
.
Of
course
he
knew
there
was
no
possibility
of
this
,
now
or
when
he
returned
home
,
for
when
you
were
married
you
never
could
be
alone
.
Presumably
that
was
the
point
.
What
was
he
going
to
tell
Anne
?
How
much
was
he
going
to
tell
her
?
He
did
n't
know
.
None
of
it
,
if
he
could
help
it
.
They
sat
at
the
table
in
the
dining
area
to
eat
an
absurdly
early
high
tea
.
Lewis
asked
him
if
he
could
remember
the
day
when
he
heard
he
had
inherited
Wyvis
Hall
and
had
walked
in
here
and
astounded
them
with
his
news
.
"
He
had
a
beard
then
,
Anne
.
"
Lewis
's
subdued
air
had
changed
to
one
of
high
good
humour
.
"
You
would
n't
have
recognized
him
,
he
looked
like
John
the
Baptist
.
"
Adam
could
remember
very
well
but
he
was
n't
going
to
say
so
.
"
What
a
funny
thing
,
"
said
Lewis
.
"
We
had
ham
salad
that
day
too
.
What
a
coincidence
!
Oh
,
yes
,
I
've
been
meaning
to
ask
you
,
who
was
it
looked
after
Wyvis
Hall
while
you
were
in
Greece
?
"
Adam
could
eat
nothing
.
The
other
time
,
he
remembered
,
it
was
his
father
who
had
n't
been
able
to
eat
.
He
did
n't
know
what
Lewis
meant
about
someone
looking
after
the
house
but
no
doubt
he
,
Adam
,
had
at
the
time
concocted
some
tale
to
keep
his
father
quiet
,
to
keep
him
away
even
.
"
Someone
from
the
village
,
you
said
,
"
Lewis
persisted
.
"
How
can
I
remember
that
far
back
?
"
"
The
police
will
want
to
know
.
It
may
be
of
vital
importance
.
"
"
Are
n't
you
going
to
eat
your
meat
,
dear
?
"
said
Beryl
.
Abigail
,
who
had
been
put
upstairs
in
one
of
the
bedrooms
to
sleep
,
set
up
a
wailing
sound
.
Adam
was
on
his
feet
at
once
.
"
I
think
we
should
go
.
"
They
had
to
wait
until
his
father
was
ready
.
Adam
would
have
preferred
to
phone
for
a
hire
car
but
Lewis
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
Anne
sat
in
the
front
in
the
passenger
seat
while
Adam
was
in
the
back
with
Abigail
.
If
his
father
could
have
found
out
what
flight
they
were
coming
on
,
the
police
certainly
could
.
It
was
possible
they
might
be
waiting
for
him
.
They
would
wish
to
interview
every
former
owner
or
occupant
of
Wyvis
Hall
.
He
looked
again
at
the
newspaper
account
of
the
adjourned
inquest
that
his
father
had
saved
for
him
.
It
would
be
owners
and
occupants
of
Wyvis
Hall
between
nine
and
twelve
years
before
that
they
would
wish
to
interview
,
and
those
were
Great-Uncle
Hilbert
,
who
was
dead
,
himself
and
Ivan
Langan
to
whom
he
had
sold
the
house
.
As
for
other
occupants
,
how
would
they
know
who
else
had
lived
there
?
It
was
ironical
that
ten
days
before
he
had
seen
Shiva
at
Heathrow
.
The
encounter
he
now
saw
as
an
omen
,
a
shadow
cast
by
a
coming
event
.
What
would
that
event
be
?
Adam
did
not
want
at
this
point
to
speculate
,
it
made
hi–
feel
sick
.
He
turned
the
newspaper
over
so
that
he
could
not
see
that
headline
and
those
paragraphs
.
In
high
spirits
,
his
father
was
talking
about
the
immense
advances
made
in
forensic
science
in
recent
years
.
As
soon
as
they
got
home
,
Anne
started
getting
Abigail
to
bed
.
Their
cases
humped
upstairs
and
put
into
the
bedroom
,
Adam
looked
Rufus
Fletcher
up
in
the
phone
book
.
He
was
in
there
twice
,
at
a
Wimpole
Street
number
and
again
at
an
address
in
Mill
Hill
:
Rufus
H.
Fletcher
,
MB
,
MRCP
.
All
these
years
then
,
or
for
some
of
them
,
Rufus
had
been
living
three
or
four
miles
from
him
.
He
could
n't
look
Shiva
up
because
he
could
n't
remember
his
surname
.
Women
marry
and
change
their
names
,
he
thought
,
there
was
no
point
in
pursuing
that
one
.
Of
course
he
could
look
up
Robin
Tatian
but
where
,
really
,
would
that
get
him
?
He
was
reaching-for
the
blue
directory
when
Anne
came
back
with
Abigail
in
her
arms
,
so
Adam
took
her
and
carried
her
back
to
bed
himself
and
tucked
her
in
and
kissed
her
.
She
was
almost
asleep
.
He
wondered
if
Rufus
had
children
and
if
so
did
he
worry
about
them
coming
to
terrible
harm
the
way
Adam
worried
?
Was
his
whole
life
affected
by
what
had
happened
at
Ecalpemos
?
Adam
might
have
escaped
the
file
memories
for
years
,
suppressed
them
and
jerked
violently
away
from
them
,
but
he
had
never
been
able
to
pretend
he
was
unscathed
by
those
events
.
Sometimes
he
felt
that
he
was
the
person
he
was
because
of
them
and
acted
the
way
he
did
because
of
their
effects
.
He
sat
by
Abigail
's
cot
,
not
wanting
to
remember
,
but
knowing
that
now
he
must
.
There
was
nothing
in
his
house
to
remind
him
of
Ecalpemos
.
Everything
that
was
left
,
everything
he
and
Rufus
had
n't
sold
,
had
gone
to
Ivan
Langan
with
the
house
.
For
a
song
,
too
,
because
he
had
not
been
able
to
bear
the
thought
of
going
back
,
meeting
a
valuer
,
walking
about
the
house
,
picking
things
off
shelves
and
out
of
cupboards
.
Only
once
had
he
returned
after
they
all
left
and
that
had
been
bad
enough
,
like
a
dream
-
no
,
like
stepping
into
the
set
and
scenario
of
some
frightening
film
,
a
Hitchcock
movie
perhaps
.
He
asked
the
taxi
he
had
taken
to
put
him
down
at
the
top
of
the
drift
and
he
had
walked
to
the
house
.
It
was
almost
a
year
since
he
had
been
there
and
in
that
time
nothing
had
been
done
,
nothing
had
been
touched
.
From
the
pine
wood
he
simply
averted
his
eyes
-
till
later
.
The
drift
was
thickly
overgrown
,
a
dank
tunnel
out
of
whose
bushy
sides
the
tendrils
of
brambles
and
briar
roses
caught
at
his
clothes
.
One
of
these
whipped
back
at
him
and
as
he
caught
at
it
a
thorn
drove
into
the
fleshy
pad
of
his
finger
.
That
thorn
had
been
there
,
festering
,
for
months
.
A
dull
cool
summer
it
had
been
,
as
different
as
could
be
from
the
year
before
.
No
golden
light
bathed
the
red
brick
of
the
house
.
It
no
longer
looked
mellow
.
Beautiful
,
yes
,
but
severe
somehow
and
,
to
Adam
's
heightened
awareness
,
reproachful
.
He
found
himself
encouraging
,
fostering
,
the
scenario
illusion
.
Only
thus
,
only
by
pretending
unreality
,
pretending
this
was
a
part
he
acted
,
could
he
go
on
,
cross
the
wild
,
shaggy
grass
,
go
past
the
black-branched
cedar
tree
,
arrive
at
the
porch
set
in
its
four
Doric
columns
and
insert
his
key
in
the
lock
.
In
the
film
there
would
have
been
something
terrible
awaiting
him
.
A
dead
thing
hanging
in
a
noose
over
the
stairs
.
There
was
nothing
of
course
,
only
a
&amp;
int
smell
compounded
of
dust
and
dry
mould
.
Ecalpemos
.
He
no
longer
called
it
that
.
It
was
Wyvis
Hall
once
more
,
his
house
,
but
bringing
him
no
pleasure
,
no
deep
,
excited
,
almost
sick
joy
.
He
breathed
deeply
,
walked
through
the
rooms
,
went
upstairs
,
being
the
actor
in
the
film
.
In
a
few
moments
the
other
participant
in
the
sequence
they
were
shooting
would
come
,
the
estate
agent
from
Sudbury
.
While
they
had
been
there
the
previous
year
there
had
been
hardly
any
visitors
.
It
was
as
if
the
magic
house
in
the
wood
had
had
an
invisible
fence
set
around
it
or
-
what
did
they
call
it
?
-
a
shutting
spell
.
The
clear
air
,
Constable
's
unique
Suffolk
light
,
had
in
fact
been
impenetrable
,
a
barrier
that
held
off
intruders
as
a
sheet
of
glass
might
have
.
This
was
all
fantasy
,
of
course
,
for
one
or
two
people
had
come
,
Evans
or
Owens
from
Hadleigh
,
the
coypu
man
,
a
meter
reader
,
the
man
who
wanted
to
do
the
garden
and
whom
he
had
turned
away
with
a
lie
.
But
for
the
most
part
they
had
been
undisturbed
in
their
magic
island
or
resort
that
was
closed
to
others
but
which
they
could
leave
when
they
pleased
.
Coming
and
going
-
there
had
been
too
much
of
that
.
Things
would
have
been
very
different
if
they
had
stayed
put
.
The
doorbell
rang
.
It
made
him
jump
-
inevitably
.
But
it
was
just
a
bell
that
rang
,
it
did
not
buzz
or
chime
.
He
let
in
the
estate
agent
and
took
him
over
the
house
,
into
the
drawing
room
and
the
dining
room
,
upstairs
to
the
Pincushion
Room
,
the
Centaur
Room
,
the
Room
of
Astonishment
,
the
Deathbed
Room
,
the
Room
Without
a
Name
,
and
then
back
down
the
back
stairs
to
that
jumble
of
kitchens
and
scullery
and
washhouse
and
coal-store
,
most
of
it
a
nineteenth
century
addition
.
What
a
lot
of
this
sort
of
thing
the
Victorians
had
needed
!
It
was
all
quite
tidy
and
clean
,
as
Vivien
had
left
it
.
But
he
could
not
say
Vivien
's
name
then
,
he
could
not
even
think
it
,
only
look
about
him
fearfully
,
clenching
his
hands
.
He
opened
the
door
to
the
gun-room
and
showed
the
estate
agent
the
interior
.
There
was
a
table
in
there
and
a
Windsor
chair
.
The
floor
was
of
black
and
red
quarry
tiles
and
there
were
racks
on
the
walls
for
the
guns
but
these
,
of
course
,
had
gone
,
Hilbert
's
two
shot-guns
had
gone
,
one
buried
in
the
Little
Wood
,
the
other
in
his
bedroom
at
home
in
Edgware
,
zipped
up
in
an
old
golf-bag
under
the
bed
.
The
estate
agent
suggested
an
asking
price
and
took
some
measurements
and
then
a
photograph
,
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
lawn
that
had
become
a
meadow
,
where
Rufus
had
stood
and
taken
photographs
a
year
before
.
It
was
windy
and
the
cedar
,
which
he
had
likened
to
a
galleon
and
Zosie
to
a
witch
,
danced
witch-like
,
its
branches
arms
and
leaping
legs
and
flying
skirts
.
The
car
went
off
up
the
drift
as
many
times
Goblander
had
gone
.
Adam
had
given
his
only
key
to
the
estate
agent
.
He
closed
the
front
door
behind
him
and
started
to
walk
.
He
had
forgotten
all
about
arranging
for
a
taxi
to
pick
him
up
or
looking
up
bus
times
or
anything
like
that
.
Presumably
,
the
estate
agent
would
have
given
him
a
lift
somewhere
.
It
was
too
late
now
.
Cold
water
drops
fell
on
his
head
from
the
leafy
roof
of
the
tunnel
.
In
the
deciduous
wood
a
pheasant
uttered
its
rattling
call
.
He
emptied
his
mind
,
he
walked
like
an
automaton
up
on
to
the
green
ride
,
seeing
at
the
end
of
it
the
cameo
of
stacked
meadows
,
segments
of
wood
,
a
church
tower
.
He
was
holding
his
breath
.
His
head
he
was
keeping
averted
,
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
drift
,
at
the
wall
of
cluster
pines
with
their
black
needles
and
their
green
cones
.
He
knew
the
distance
from
the
ride
,
thirty
paces
.
When
he
turned
his
head
he
kept
his
eyes
closed
,
let
out
his
breath
,
opened
his
eyes
,
looked
and
heard
himself
give
a
little
whimpering
sigh
.
It
was
the
sound
a
man
might
make
when
in
physical
pain
but
trying
not
to
show
it
,
suppressing
complaint
.
There
was
nothing
to
see
,
nothing
to
show
.
The
place
was
as
it
had
always
been
,
a
downland
in
miniature
,
a
terrain
of
small
green
hills
on
which
little
dolmens
had
been
raised
,
pink
granite
,
white
marble
,
a
slab
or
two
of
grey
stone
.
Wooden
crosses
.

By
what
eternal
streams
,
Pinto

Each
in
their
narrow
cells
for
ever
laid
were
Alexander
,
Sal
,
Monty
,
Ranger
,
Blaze
.
And
to
the
right
of
Blaze
the
green
turf
lay
undisturbed
,
very
slightly
irregular
,
as
the
whole
area
was
,
a
reticulation
of
tiny-leaved
plants
,
minuscule
flowers
,
netted
into
the
grass
,
a
small
pit
here
filled
with
pine
needles
,
a
shallow
rut
there
with
a
sandy
bottom
.
Rabbits
had
mown
the
lawn
here
more
effectively
than
any
piece
of
machinery
.
Their
droppings
lay
about
like
scattered
handfuls
of
raisins
.
Adam
found
he
was
holding
both
hands
clamped
over
his
mouth
.
He
turned
and
ran
,
along
the
ride
,
up
the
drift
,
not
looking
back
.
Anne
,
waiting
downstairs
for
him
with
coffee
and
sandwiches
on
a
tray
,
wanted
to
talk
about
the
find
at
Wyvis
Hall
.
He
found
himself
unexpectedly
touched
by
her
simple
assumption
,
the
way
she
absolutely
took
it
for
granted
,
that
he
was
innocent
.
Adam
did
n't
want
anything
to
eat
.
He
was
thinking
of
Hilbert
's
shot-gun
that
he
still
had
but
which
he
should
perhaps
not
keep
much
longer

In
fact
,
he
could
n't
remember
ever
having
heard
of
it
until
the
day
Shiva
came
in
and
told
them
what
he
had
found
.
Vivien
thought
it
was
children
buried
there
.
Adam
shivered
as
he
remembered
that
.
Well
,
with
her
bent
towards
Indian
mysticism
she
would
n't
be
able
to
understand
the
way
they
went
on
about
animals
.
Adam
had
a
sudden
awful
vision
of
the
spade
going
through
that
green
turf
and
coming
up
with
a
skull
on
it
.
Something
like
that
,
it
must
have
been
like
that
.
Was
the
shot
still
there
,
among
the
bones
?
Later
he
lay
in
bed
beside
Anne
,
trying
to
think
of
a
satisfactory
yet
thoroughly
non-committal
story
to
tell
the
police
.
Like
most
middle-class
English
people
who
have
never
had
anything
to
do
with
them
,
Adam
thought
the
police
were
fools
.
Anne
had
fallen
asleep
almost
immediately
.
She
had
a
habit
,
when
she
slept
on
her
back
,
of
making
soft
sounds
in
her
throat
.
This
was
not
snoring
but
a
kind
of
clicking
,
irregular
and
sporadic
-
that
was
what
made
it
irritating
-
and
liable
to
start
when
least
expected
.
Adam
had
only
heard
one
other
make
these
sounds
and
when
he
first
heard
Anne
make
them
his
memory
escape
failed
and
those
two
nights
were
startlingly
evoked
,
so
disturbingly
in
fact
that
he
had
the
terrible
delusion
that
Anne
was
doing
it
to
mock
him
.
Of
course
that
was
nonsense
.
She
had
never
heard
of
Catherine
Ryemark
and
never
would
if
he
had
his
way
.
Several
minutes
might
pass
without
a
click
and
then
one
would
come
and
another
would
come
and
another
one
fifteen
seconds
after
that
.
It
drove
Adam
mad
.
Once
,
in
a
fit
of
temper
,
he
had
told
her
she
only
started
doing
it
after
they
were
married
.
If
he
had
heard
her
do
that
in
their
single
days
he
would
never
have
married
her
.
But
now
,
the
soft
clicks
coming
with
typical
irregularity
,
he
listened
to
them
painfully
and
let
his
mind
slide
back
ten
years
to
what
he
must
remember
,
to
the
truth
he
must
recall
if
he
were
going
to
be
able
to
tell
lies
.
He
lay
still
with
his
eyes
open
,
staring
into
the
darkness
that
was
only
half-darkness
because
this
was
London
and
not
Suffolk
,
where
on
moonless
nights
the
small
hours
were
black
as
velvet
.
Click
,
pause
,
click
,
a
long
silence
.
At
last
it
had
been
cold
enough
to
need
a
blanket
and
a
quilt
,
to
hold
Zosie
in
his
arms
without
the
sweat
pouring
off
them
both
.
For
a
long
time
that
night
too
he
had
not
slept
,
had
lain
thinking
,
wondering
what
to
do
,
listening
to
the
delicate
sounds
like
tiny
bubbles
breaking
-
and
then
hearing
them
no
more
.
Adam
closed
his
eyes
and
turned
his
head
away
from
Anne
.
A
down-stuffed
duvet
in
a
printed-cotton
cover
lay
over
them
.
It
had
been
a
quilt
at
Ecalpemos
,
faded
yellow
satin
,
brought
in
by
Vivien
from
the
terrace
when
the
rain
began
.
Quilts
were
what
you
lay
on
to
sunbathe
that
summer
,
not
for
warmth
on
beds
,
but
slung
for
lounging
comfort
as
it
might
be
on
some
Damascus
rooftop
.
Night
after
night
they
had
lain
out
there
in
the
soft
,
scented
warmth
,
looking
at
the
stars
,
or
lighting
candles
stuck
in
Rufus
's
wine
bottles
,
eating
and
drinking
,
talking
,
hoping
and
happy
.
That
summer
-
there
had
never
been
another
like
it
,
before
or
since
.
It
was
the
hottest
,
driest
summer
any
of
them
had
ever
known
.
The
previous
one
,
1975
,
had
been
very
good
,
especially
the
latter
part
,
but
that
one
,
the
summer
of
Hilbert
's
death
and
of
Ecalpemos
,
had
been
glorious
from
April
till
September
.
If
it
had
been
grey
and
raining
and
chilly
he
might
have
taken
one
look
at
Wyvis
Hall
and
turned
tail
and
fled
to
Crete
or
Delos
or
somewhere
.
Certainly
he
would
have
gone
down
there
alone
to
spy
out
the
land
and
check
on
his
property
.
Rufus
would
n't
have
wanted
to
go
and
he
would
have
had
to
go
down
on
his
own
by
train
.
There
were
so
many
ifs
and
conditions
,
so
many
other
eventualities
that
easily
might
have
happened
.
In
the
first
place
he
had
only
approached
Rufus
because
Rufus
had
a
car
.
If
his
father
had
n't
been
so
bloody-minded
and
had
let
him
use
the
family
car
,
he
would
no
doubt
have
gone
down
alone
and
come
back
next
day
,
having
called
on
some
estate
agent
in
Hadleigh
or
Sudbury
and
asked
them
to
sell
the
house
for
him
,
the
very
one
probably
that
he
had
gone
to
in
the
following
year
.
But
things
had
not
gone
that
way
.
It
had
been
a
glorious
sunny
day
and
he
had
wakened
up
in
the
morning
rather
early
for
him
in
those
days
.
About
nine
.
His
other
was
on
holiday
,
though
he
and
his
mother
were
not
going
away
anywhere
,
in
spite
of
what
the
doctor
had
advised
,
but
staying
at
home
and
"
going
out
for
days
"
.
Or
that
was
what
they
said
.
They
had
n't
been
out
for
any
days
since
Adam
had
been
at
home
.
18
June
it
was
,
a
Friday
.
The
date
was
stamped
indelibly
on
his
memory
calendar
,
more
than
just
stamped
,
etched
in
.
He
thought
he
would
get
up
and
go
to
Suffolk
and
take
a
look
at
his
house
.
His
generation
-
perhaps
all
generations
at
that
age
-
hated
making
plans
,
making
arrangements
ahead
.
Adam
had
viewed
with
near-incredulity
his
mother
's
preparations
in
the
past
for
going
on
holiday
,
the
way
everything
in
the
house
seemed
to
get
washed
,
the
way
she
and
his
father
wore
their
worst
clothes
for
days
beforehand
because
the
best
ones
were
packed
,
the
phone
calls
she
made
,
the
notes
she
left
for
tradesmen
.
He
liked
to
do
things
spontaneously
,
be
up
and
off
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
.
His
other
would
n't
let
him
have
the
car
.
It
might
be
needed
if
they
went
out
for
the
day
.
Adam
said
all
right
,
not
to
worry
,
he
would
manage
without
,
but
this
did
n't
seem
to
please
Lewis
either
.
He
would
have
liked
,
Adam
knew
,
to
have
lived
in
a
time
when
a
father
could
forbid
his
son
to
do
things
and
the
son
would
obey
.
Or
rather
,
to
have
the
rules
of
that
former
period
prevailing
now
.
Adam
did
n't
say
where
he
planned
to
go
,
though
he
thought
his
father
guessed
,
but
got
on
his
bicycle
and
cycled
over
to
Rufus
's
.
He
could
n't
remember
what
he
had
done
with
his
bike
when
he
got
to
the
Fletchers
'
,
left
it
there
and
collected
it
next
day
perhaps
,
but
he
could
remember
most
of
the
rest
of
it
.
What
he
had
worn
,
for
instance
.
Jeans
cut
off
thigh-high
to
make
shorts
and
a
T-shirt
he
had
made
out
of
an
old
man
's
vest
he
had
bought
for
20p
in
a
sale
under
the
arches
at
Charing
Cross
Station
and
dyed
green
and
yellow
.
His
hair
was
tied
back
with
a
piece
of
tinsel
string
he
had
found
in
the
Christmas
decorations
box
.
Those
were
the
days
before
people
dyed
their
hair
bright
colours
,
the
days
of
henna
.
Adam
had
put
henna
on
his
hair
and
that
and
the
sun
had
turned
it
reddish-gold
.
His
beard
,
though
,
was
black
and
rather
curly
.
He
must
have
looked
a
sight
but
he
did
n't
think
so
then
.
His
legs
were
bare
and
he
was
wearing
Indian
leather
sandals
,
the
kind
you
had
to
soak
in
water
before
you
first
put
them
on
.
It
showed
what
the
weather
was
and
how
they
had
started
taking
daily
sunshine
for
granted
that
he
had
n't
got
any
sort
of
jacket
or
sweater
with
him
even
though
he
expected
to
be
away
overnight
.
The
Fletchers
had
a
swimming
pool
.
It
was
supposed
to
be
a
teardrop
shape
or
shaped
like
a
comma
.
This
summer
was
the
first
anyone
had
made
much
use
of
the
pool
.
Rufus
was
sitting
on
the
blue-tiled
rim
of
it
with
his
feet
dangling
in
the
water
.
He
was
three
years
older
than
Adam
and
though
they
had
been
at
the
same
school
,
Highgate
,
they
had
not
been
friends
then
.
It
was
Rufus
's
younger
brother
Julius
who
had
been
in
the
same
form
as
Adam
,
a
rather
dull
,
pompous
boy
,
a
sort
of
phoney
intellectual
,
and
they
had
never
had
much
to
do
with
one
another
.
Adam
and
Rufus
had
met
as
members
of
the
same
squash
club
.
That
was
what
they
seemed
to
have
in
common
,
that
and
Rufus
's
brother
and
Adam
knowing
each
other
already
,
but
after
a
while
Adam
got
to
see
things
he
admired
in
Rufus
,
his
toughness
,
the
way
he
'd
got
himself
organized
and
in
hand
,
the
way
he
knew
where
he
was
going
and
yet
still
could
be
amusing
and
casual
.
Of
course
he
had
got
to
know
him
a
good
deal
better
at
Ecalpemos
-
Rufus
was
very
laid-back
and
Adam
liked
that
.
He
also
liked
Rufus
's
occasional
sensitivity
,
which
did
n't
seem
to
go
with
the
other
aspects
of
his
personality
.
And
Rufus
was
wild
too
,
the
way
medical
students
had
a
reputation
for
being
.
Adam
thought
of
himself
and
Rufus
as
being
wild
and
laid-back
at
the
same
time
,
equally
like
that
,
young
adventurers
with
all
the
world
before
them
and
all
the
time
they
wanted
to
do
what
they
liked
with
.
Rufus
said
,
Hi
,
and
come
for
a
swim
,
so
Adam
took
off
his
shorts
and
went
into
the
water
in
his
black
nylon
underpants
.
They
would
has/e
swum
naked
only
Rufus
's
father
had
discovered
them
doing
this
and
made
a
fuss
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
offence
,
if
offence
it
was
.
"
I
reckoned
I
might
go
and
take
a
look
at
my
inheritance

Adam
said
,
checking
that
the
key
to
Wyvis
Hall
was
safe
in
the
pocket
of
his
shorts
.

Rufus
had
an
old
Morris
Minor
van
that
he
had
bought
third-
or
fourth
hand
,
but
it
went
all
right
.
It
got
you
from
A
to
B
in
one
piece
,
as
Adam
's
father
remarked
sneeringly
of
it
.
That
had
been
well
before
the
motorway
,
the
M25
,
was
built
.
You
went
to
Suffolk
by
the
A12
through
Chelmsford
or
took
the
country
route
.
This
was
what
Lewis
had
always
called
the
route
that
went
by
narrower
,
winding
roads
through
Ongar
and
Dunmow
,
Braintree
and
Halstead
to
Sudbury
,
and
that
was
the
way
he
had
driven
them
when
they
all
went
out
to
visit
old
Hilbert
.
Adam
did
for
Rufus
what
Lewis
would
have
called
"
navigating
"
.
It
maddened
Adam
,
his
misuse
of
this
word
,
which
could
n't
of
course
be
applied
to
guiding
anyone
on
land
,
coming
as
it
did
from
the
Latin
navigare
and
thence
from
navis
,
feminine
,
a
ship
,
and
agere
,
to
drive
or
guide
.
Adam
loved
words
,
was
fascinated
by
them
,
their
meanings
and
what
you
could
do
with
them
,
with
anagrams
and
palindromes
and
rhetorical
terms
and
etymology
.
One
of
the
subjects
in
the
mixed
B
A
course
he
was
doing
at
university
was
linguistics
-
"
Directing
"
Rufus
was
what
he
was
doing
,
he
told
himself
.
They
had
talked
about
words
during
that
drive
,
well
,
place-names
really
,
with
particular
reference
to
the
villages
that
were
called
Roding
after
the
river
:
High
Roding
,
Berners
Roding
,
Margaret
Roding
,
and
Rufus
told
him
they
were
pronounced
Roothing
from
the
old
Danish
,
which
Adam
had
n't
known
before
.
It
was
a
beautiful
drive
and
the
countryside
looked
wonderful
,
a
kind
of
sparkling
shimmering
green
in
the
heat
and
sunshine
.
The
sky
was
huge
,
a
pale
,
bright
,
cloudless
blue
,
and
the
white
surface
of
the
road
ahead
rippled
in
the
heat
mirages
that
made
it
look
like
little
waves
.
The
farmers
were
haymaking
,
cutting
the
tall
feathery
grass
and
its
dense
admixture
of
wild
flowers
.
The
windows
of
the
van
were
wide
open
and
they
had
the
radio
on
,
not
playing
rock
,
which
they
both
hated
,
but
Mozart
,
one
of
the
better
known
of
the
piano
concertos
.
In
spite
of
all
the
times
he
had
been
there
Adam
missed
the
turn-off
that
was
the
drift
leading
down
to
Wyvis
Hall
.
It
was
somewhere
along
the
lane
between
Nunes
and
Hadleigh
but
so
much
vegetation
had
grown
up
that
spring
that
everything
looked
different
.
They
drove
about
a
mile
further
,
right
up
to
the
group
of
buildings
called
the
Mill
in
the
Pytle
,
and
Rufus
,
turning
the
van
round
,
asked
what
a
pytle
was
.
Adam
said
he
would
look
it
up
.
He
told
Rufus
to
drive
a
bit
more
slowly
and
this
time
he
spotted
the
six-foot-wide
gap
in
the
hedge
with
,
on
the
right-hand
side
,
almost
hidden
by
cow
parsley
growing
up
and
elderflowers
hanging
down
,
the
wooden
box
on
legs
with
its
hinged
lid
into
which
Hilbert's-mail
and
newspapers
and
milk
had
been
delivered
.
As
a
little
boy
,
Adam
had
sometimes
been
sent
up
here
in
the
morning
to
fetch
the
letters
and
the
paper
,
carrying
with
him
a
wicker
bottle-basket
for
the
milk
.
There
was
no
other
sign
that
this
was
Wyvis
Hall
.
"
Why
's
it
called
a
drift
?
"
said
Rufus
,
lighting
another
cigarette
.
He
had
chain-smoked
all
the
way
down
and
Adam
had
had
one
or
two
to
keep
him
company
,
though
he
did
n't
really
like
putting
something
lighted
in
his
mouth
.
That
was
the
trouble
for
him
with
dope
.
He
liked
the
effects
of
it
but
did
n't
like
having
to
smoke
it
.
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
he
said
.
"
I
do
n't
know
why
it
's
called
a
drift
.
"
"
You
can
look
it
up
when
you
look
up
"
pytle
"
,
"
said
Rufus
.
On
either
side
the
drift
was
thick
with
cow
parsley
,
its
powdery
white
heads
coming
to
an
end
of
their
long
blooming
.
It
had
a
sweetish
scent
,
like
icing
sugar
,
like
childhood
birthday
cakes
,
that
mingled
with
the
winey
perfume
of
the
elders
.
All
the
trees
were
in
full
leaf
but
the
oaks
and
beeches
had
not
long
so
been
,
so
that
their
foliage
was
still
a
fresh
,
bright
colour
and
the
lime
trees
were
hung
with
pale
,
yellow-green
,
dangling
flowers
.
The
pine
wood
looked
just
the
same
as
ever
,
it
always
did
,
it
was
always
dark
and
dense
with
very
narrow
passages
through
it
that
would
surely
allow
nothing
bigger
than
a
fox
to
weave
its
way
through
.
Imperceptibly
the
trees
must
have
grown
,
yet
they
seemed
to
Adam
no
different
from
when
he
was
a
child
coming
up
to
fetch
the
milk
and
when
,
on
sunless
mornings
,
he
had
felt
a
kind
of
menace
from
the
wood
.
Even
then
he
had
not
liked
to
look
into
it
too
much
but
had
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ground
or
straight
ahead
of
him
because
the
wood
was
the
kind
of
place
you
saw
in
story-book
illustrations
or
even
in
your
dreams
and
out
of
which
things
were
liable
to
come
creeping
.
At
the
foot
of
the
slope
,
through
the
thinning
trees
,
a
field
maple
,
alders
with
their
feet
in
the
stream
,
a
late-blooming
chestnut
,
that
dramatic
lawn-adornment
,
the
cedar
,
the
house
came
into
view
.
Things
,
buildings
,
stretches
of
land
,
are
said
to
look
smaller
when
we
grow
up
.
And
this
seems
only
natural
,
just
what
one
would
expect
.
After
all
,
the
top
of
the
table
that
was
once
on
a
line
with
our
chin
now
reaches
only
to
our
thighs
.
Wyvis
Hall
,
logically
,
should
have
looked
smaller
to
Adam
but
it
did
not
,
it
looked
much
larger
.
This
must
have
been
because
it-was
his
now
,
he
owned
it
.
It
was
his
and
it
seemed
a
palace
.
On
the
stable
block
,
in
which
nothing
had
ever
been
stabled
in
Adam
's
memory
,
was
a
little
tower
with
a
running
fox
weathervane
on
it
and
below
the
small
pitched
roof
a
blue
clock
with
hands
of
gold
.
The
hands
had
stopped
at
five
to
four
.
Between
the
block
and
the
house
you
could
just
see
the
walls
of
the
walled
garden
,
flint-built
,
crossed
and
coped
with
brick-work
.
A
mass
of
flowers
covered
the
house
,
a
pink
climbing
rose
and
a
creamy
clematis
.
Adam
had
not
known
these
names
,
but
later
on
Mary
Gage
had
told
him
.
Because
the
sun
shone
so
brightly
the
slate
roof
blazed
like
a
slab
of
silver
.
Rufus
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
porch
.
The
whole
area
out
here
was
paved
and
small
stonecrops
and
sedums
with
white
and
yellow
starry
flowers
grew
up
between
the
stones
.
In
a
couple
of
narrow-mouthed
stone
vessels
grew
a
conifer
and
a
bay
tree
.
The
rose
which
mantled
the
house
must
have
put
out
a
thousand
flowers
and
these
were
at
the
peak
of
their
blooming
,
not
a
petal
yet
shed
,
each
blossom
the
pink
of
a
shell
within
and
the
pink
of
coral
on
its
outer
side
.
Adam
got
out
of
the
van
and
felt
in
the
pocket
of
his
shorts
for
the
key
.
He
was
aware
of
a
profoundly
warm
,
placid
,
peaceful
silence
as
if
the
house
were
a
happy
animal
asleep
in
the
sun
.
"
And
this
is
all
yours
?
"
said
Rufus
.
"
All
mine
.
"
Adam
was
equally
cool
.
"
I
should
be
so
lucky
in
my
avuncular
arrangements
.
"
Adam
unlocked
the
front
door
and
they
went
inside
.
The
windows
had
been
closed
for
nearly
three
months
and
the
place
had
a
dusty
smell
that
got
into
your
throat
and
made
your
eyes
smart
.
It
was
also
very
hot
,
for
the
drawing
room
faced
due
south
and
the
hot
sun
beat
on
the
glass
.
Adam
went
about
opening
windows
.
The
furniture
was
all
his
too
,
those
cabinets
with
bulging
fronts
and
curved
legs
,
chairs
with
buttoned
backs
,
a
velvet-covered
love
seat
,
a
big
oval
table
supported
on
a
wooden
base
shaped
like
a
vase
,
mirrors
framed
in
gilt
,
pale
mauve
and
green
watercolours
and
dark
portraits
in
oils
.
He
could
not
remember
noticing
any
of
this
before
.
It
had
been
there
but
he
had
not
seen
it
.
Nor
noticed
the
pillars
of
rosy
marble
that
supported
the
window
embrasure
,
nor
the
alcoves
,
glass-fronted
,
that
were
filled
with
china
.
Only
the
overall
impression
was
familiar
,
not
the
individual
pieces
.
He
felt
a
little
sick
,
engorged
with
possessions
and
the
pride
of
ownership
.
In
each
room
a
chandelier
hung
from
the
ceiling
,
of
tarnished
brass
in
the
dining
room
,
a
cascade
of
prisms
in
the
drawing
room
,
in
hall
and
study
Italianate
glass
tubes
twisted
snake-like
amid
false
candles
.
And
everywhere
the
sun
streamed
or
lay
in
golden
pools
or
rainbow
spots
or
squares
made
by
windows
patterned
with
the
shadows
of
leaves
.
Rufus
was
among
the
bookcases
in
Hilbert
's
study
.
Adam
took
down
Edward
Moor
's
Suffolk
Words
and
Phrases
,
could
n't
find
"
drift
"
but
here
was
"
pytle
"
or
"
pightle
"
,
a
small
meadow
.
He
went
back
into
the
drawing
room
where
he
unbolted
,
unlocked
and
threw
open
the
french
windows
.
The
sun
came
to
him
in
a
warm
gust
or
like
a
warm
veil
enveloping
him
.
It
whitened
the
terrace
beyond
with
a
clear
,
unbroken
glare
.
All
along
the
terrace
,
on
the
low
wall
that
bounded
it
,
stood
the
statuary
his
father
had
once
told
him
had
been
placed
there
by
whoever
inhabited
the
place
before
Hilbert
and
Lilian
came
.
They
represented
,
in
some
kind
of
fine-grained
grey
stone
,
the
loves
of
Zeus
.
He
remembered
them
all
right
.
As
a
child
he
had
studied
them
with
fascination
,
enquiring
what
the
bull
was
doing
to
the
lady
,
and
receiving
from
his
parents
no
very
satisfying
answer
.
Hilbert
he
had
been
too
much
in
awe
of
to
ask
.
They
had
come
from
Italy
.
Some
cousin
of
Lilian
's
two
or
three
times
removed
had
found
them
in
Florence
while
there
on
her
honeymoon
and
had
had
them
shipped
home
.
There
was
Zeus
as
Amphitryon
with
Alcmene
;
Zeus
coming
to
Danae
in
a
shower
of
gold
(
difficult
in
stone
,
this
one
)
;
snatching
Europa
;
swan-shaped
,
wooing
Leda
;
standing
before
the
hapless
Semele
in
all
his
destructive
glory
,
and
in
half
a
dozen
other
metamorphoses
.
Someone
had
been
looking
after
the
garden
,
you
could
see
that
.
Flower
beds
had
been
weeded
,
dead
heads
removed
,
the
borders
of
the
willow-fringed
lake
shorn
and
trimmed
,
the
lawns
recently
mown
.
As
they
walked
along
one
of
the
stone-flagged
paths
and
came
to
the
gate
in
the
flint
wall
they
saw
a
neat
pile
of
mowings
waiting
,
apparently
,
to
be
composted
.
The
walled
garden
too
had
been
carefully
maintained
.
Inside
the
netted
fruit
cage
Adam
saw
the
bright
,
ripe
,
vermilion
gleam
of
strawberries
nestling
among
their
triform
leaves
,
raspberries
yet
green
on
the
canes
.
All
along
the
facing
wall
espaliered
trees
,
their
trunks
dark
and
shiny
and
twisted
and
knobbed
,
bore
among
a
rough
,
dull
foliage
fruit
turning
gold
.
Nectarines
,
Adam
remembered
,
and
peaches
too
.
Were
n't
there
greengages
somewhere
that
scarcely
ever
fruited
but
when
they
did
were
splendid
?
Red
and
white
currants
here
in
rows
,
berries
like
glass
beads
,
gooseberries
with
a
ripeness
the
colour
of
rust
on
their
green
cheeks
.
They
each
took
a
handful
of
strawberries
.
They
walked
to
the
lake
where
there
were
two
pairs
of
ducks
,
mallards
with
feathers
as
if
painted
in
iridescent
green
,
and
from
which
a
heron
rose
on
gaunt
wings
,
its
legs
dangling
.
Adam
looked
back
at
the
house
,
at
the
honeysuckle
that
curtained
the
back
of
it
in
yellow
and
pink
,
at
the
martins
,
sharp-pinioned
,
that
wheeled
in
and
out
from
the
eaves
.
He
was
in
a
state
of
tremulous
excitement
.
He
seemed
only
to
be
able
to
breathe
shallowly
.
It
was
curiously
sexual
this
feeling
,
exactly
the
way
he
had
once
or
twice
felt
with
a
girl
he
was
mad
to
make
love
to
and
who
he
thought
would
let
him
but
was
not
quite
sure
,
not
absolutely
sure
.
The
slightest
thing
would
turn
his
fortune
,
snatch
it
,
send
him
home
frustrated
,
bitter
,
in
a
sick
rage
.
He
felt
like
that
now
.
If
only
he
could
breathe
properly
!
And
here
was
the
finest
country
air
,
transparent
sparkling
sun
,
the
distant
low
hills
and
soft
basking
meadows
half-hidden
by
the
blue
haze
of
noon
.
"
You
're
actually
going
to
sell
this
place
?
"
Rufus
lit
a
cigarette
,
offered
him
one
.
Adam
shook
his
head
.
"
What
else
can
I
do
?
"
What
choice
did
he
have
?
He
could
n't
live
there
,
he
could
n't
keep
it
up
.
Adam
lay
in
bed
beside
Anne
,
his
mind
repeating
what
he
had
said
to
Rufus
on
that
wonderful
day
in
June
.
"
What
else
can
I
do
?
"
Of
course
he
should
have
said
I
do
n't
have
a
choice
.
Come
on
,
I
'm
hungry
,
let's
go
get
some
lunch
and
then
we
'll
find
an
estate
agent
.
But
they
had
bought
food
on
their
way
coming
through
Halstead
,
the
1976
version
of
takeaway
,
a
couple
of
meat
pies
,
apples
,
Coke
,
and
they
had
had
lunch
lying
in
the
grass
by
the
lake
.
The
magical
quality
of
the
place
crept
on
them
there
like
a
spell
,
the
warmth
and
the
sunshine
and
the
scents
of
the
garden
and
the
tranquil
silence
.
But
it
was
more
than
that
.
There
was
an
indefinable
ingredient
,
a
kind
of
excitement
.
It
had
something
to
do
with
history
and
the
past
,
that
excitement
,
and
something
to
do
with
potential
as
well
,
with
what
Orwell
or
somebody
had
said
,
that
every
man
really
knew
in
his
heart
the
finest
place
to
be
was
the
countryside
on
a
summer
's
day
.
I
was
happy
,
Adam
thought
,
that
's
what
it
was
.
The
Garden
of
Eden
.
Shiva
had
called
it
that
,
but
in
his
mouth
it
had
not
been
the
hackneyed
expression
it
would
have
been
if
an
English
person
had
so
referred
to
it
.
He
was
drawing
an
interesting
image
from
the
mythology
of
another
culture
and
it
had
seemed
to
him
fresh
and
new
.
Adam
had
merely
shrugged
.
The
Garden
of
Eden
was
the
way
certain
people
would
describe
any
charming
landscape
.
Yet
the
phrase
had
remained
with
him
,
particularly
in
its
darker
aspect
,
the
way
it
appears
to
most
of
those
who
are
bound
by
the
puritan
ethic
,
not
as
a
haven
to
live
in
and
enjoy
but
as
a
paradise
to
be
expelled
from
.
It
was
almost
as
if
a
necessary
condition
of
being
in
this
paradise
was
the
commission
of
some
frightful
sin
or
crime
that
must
result
in
expulsion
from
it
.
On
the
day
they
had
gone
,
when
the
summer
was
over
and
the
skies
grey
and
a
wind
blowing
,
he
had
thought
of
that
image
.
Their
departure
had
something
in
it
of
the
bowed
and
wretched
mien
of
Adam
and
Eve
in
the
many
"
expulsion
"
paintings
he
had
later
seen
,
and
by
then
the
Garden
itself
had
a
ruined
look
,
paradise
destroyed
.
He
got
out
of
bed
to
have
a
pee
.
He
and
Anne
had
a
bathroom
opening
out
of
their
bedroom
but
Adam
,
when
he
got
up
in
the
night
,
usually
went
to
the
other
one
that
was
on
the
far
side
of
the
landing
.
This
was
because
his
reason
for
getting
up
at
all
was
to
see
if
Abigail
was
all
right
.
But
he
had
used
their
bathroom
and
was
back
in
bed
again
before
he
realized
that
he
had
forgotten
to
look
at
his
daughter
.
His
anxiety
for
her
had
been
displaced
by
a
greater
worry
-
was
that
possible
?
Ever
since
her
birth
he
had
been
ultra-anxious
without
expressing
,
even
to
himself
alone
,
his
reasons
for
this
.
Of
course
he
knew
what
those
reasons
were
but
he
had
never
faced
them
.
Now
he
did
and
they
did
not
seem
absurd
,
they
seemed
like
good
reasons
.
He
got
up
again
and
padded
across
to
Abigail
's
room
.
Suppose
,
after
all
,
that
he
had
not
gone
to
look
and
in
the
morning
they
had
found
her
stiff
and
cold
in
her
cot
,
her
eyes
glazed
and
unfocused
,
her
lips
blue
?
He
shivered
,
gooseflesh
standing
on
his
face
and
arms
.
Abigail
lay
on
her
side
,
well
tucked
in
,
the
teddy
bear
she
was
too
young
for
sitting
in
the
corner
by
her
feet
.
Adam
stood
watching
her
,
listening
to
her
silent
sleep
.
With
the
specialist
's
contempt
for
the
layman
's
ignorance
,
Rufus
read
accounts
of
the
inquest
in
two
newspapers
.
More
prominence
was
given
to
the
evidence
of
Alec
Chipstead
than
to
that
of
the
Home
Office
Pathologist
,
Dr
Aubrey
Helier
.
The
stuff
Rufus
wanted
to
know
would
be
beyond
the
average
reader
's
comprehension
.
He
should
really
have
gone
to
that
inquest
.
That
could
be
remedied
,
he
could
acquire
a
transcript
of
the
proceedings
or
simply
a
copy
of
the
pathologist
's
findings
,
but
he
did
not
dare
,
he
was
not
prepared
to
show
his
hand
to
that
extent
.
Instead
he
tried
to
guess
what
might
have
been
said
.
He
put
himself
into
the
pathologist
's
shoes
and
stood
in
the
witness
box
.
He
spoke
of
how
he
had
established
the
sex
of
the
larger
skeleton
.
A
fragment
of
the
uterus
remaining
perhaps
?
It
was
this
soft
part
that
often
persisted
longest
.
"
Having
established
that
the
larger
skeleton
was
that
of
a
female
,
I
set
about
making
an
estimate
of
the
subject
's
age
at
the
time
of
her
death
.
It
should
be
explained
that
between
the
ages
of
twelve
and
thirty
the
union
of
the
epiphyses
of
most
of
the
long
bones
with
the
shafts
takes
place
,
and
by
the
age
of
twenty-four
most
of
the
epiphyses
have
united
.
In
the
case
of
the
subject
I
shall
henceforward
designate
as
Subject
A
I
found
that
the
medial
end
of
the
clavicle
had
not
yet
fused
,
though
fusion
had
taken
place
at
the
acromion
and
verical
border
scapula
.
The
bones
of
the
arm
had
for
the
most
part
fused
but
fusion
had
not
yet
taken
place
between
the
radius
and
ulna
,
which
would
be
expected
to
have
occurred
by
the
age
of
twenty-one
.
The
heads
of
the
metatarsals
were
fused
,
which
one
would
expect
to
be
accomplished
by
nineteen
years
,
but
fusion
had
not
taken
place
in
the
secondary
pelvic
centres
.
The
sutures
of
the
skull
remained
open
on
their
inner
aspects
-
"
Something
like
that
it
must
have
been
.
He
would
not
have
been
able
to
put
a
precise
age
on
the
skeleton
.
Between
seventeen
and
twenty-one
,
say
.
And
the
cause
of
death
?
Rufus
had
another
look
at
the
paper
.
The
pathologist
had
said
it
was
at
this
stage
impossible
to
give
an
opinion
but
the
report
also
said
the
police
were
treating
the
case
as
murder
.
There
was
nothing
about
how
the
pathologist
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
death
had
taken
place
some
time
between
1974
and
1977
.
Rufus
guessed
again
.
"
Certain
highly
technical
factors
,
intelligible
only
to
the
expert
and
with
which
I
will
not
take
up
the
time
of
this
inquest
,
have
led
me
to
conclude
that
Subject
A
had
been
dead
for
more
than
nine
years
and
less
than
twelve
.
Suffice
it
to
say
that
I
reached
this
estimate
on
the
basis
of
the
preservation
of
a
vestige
of
the
uterus
and
as
a
result
of
obtaining
a
chemical
reaction
for
blood
from
periosteum
.
I
should
not
have
expected
to
obtain
such
a
reaction
if
more
than
twelve
years
had
elapsed
since
death
.
"
It
was
only
conjecture
about
that
bit
of
uterus
.
Rufus
wondered
if
he
might
have
invented
that
part
because
he
had
so
much
to
do
with
wombs
in
the
course
of
his
own
daily
life
.
He
knew
very
little
about
tests
done
on
blood
from
bones
,
only
that
they
could
be
carried
out
.
Identification
of
"
Subject
A
"
would
be
a
more
difficult
matter
altogether
.
There
was
no
mention
of
hair
,
though
Rufus
knew
hair
could
persist
intact
for
far
more
years
than
those
bones
had
been
in
the
grave
,
and
there
was
nothing
about
clothing
.
Would
ten
years
in
the
earth
have
destroyed
that
cotton
shroud
?
He
imagined
a
policeman
with
nothing
more
to
go
on
than
a
tiny
,
once
brightly
embroidered
,
label
,
a
square
inch
of
bloodstained
,
earth-stained
,
half-rotted
cloth
,
hawking
it
round
boutiques
in
Kilburn
and
West
Hendon
,
narrowing
the
field
,
finally
coming
to
an
importers
'
warehouse
-
But
no
,
she
had
n't
been
wearing
that
dress
,
of
course
she
had
n't
.
He
asked
himself
how
accurate
his
memory
in
fact
was
,
how
much
time
and
a
desire
to
repudiate
the
past
had
blocked
off
.
He
ought
to
try
to
remember
,
he
must
.
There
were
ways
of
bringing
memories
to
the
surface
and
he
must
use
them
to
protect
himself
.
It
was
imperative
too
to
keep
cool
and
not
allow
things
to
get
out
of
proportion
.
Most
likely
they
would
proceed
no
further
than
they
had
with
the
identification
of
"
Subject
A
"
,
especially
since
there
was
no
one
(
apart
from
themselves
)
to
miss
her
and
she
had
never
been
missed
.
In
the
case
of
a
person
missing
ten
years
before
who
had
never
been
reported
missing
,
what
hope
was
there
now
of
establishing
identity
?
It
might
be
somewhat
different
with
regard
to
the
other
occupant
of
the
grave
.
Rufus
became
the
pathologist
again
.
"
Now
to
the
remains
of
the
infant
I
shall
call
Subject
B.
Examination
of
the
pelvis
usually
allows
sex
to
be
determined
with
great
confidence
in
very
young
children
and
even
in
the
foetus
.
I
found
in
Subject
B
the
greater
sciatic
notch
to
be
wide
and
shallow
and
the
ischial
tuberosities
to
be
everted
,
the
ilia
inclined
to
the
vertical
and
the
brim
of
the
pelvis
almost
circular
in
outline
.
The
sub-pubic
angle
was
rounded
and
somewhat
of
the
order
of
90
degrees
.
I
can
therefore
state
with
total
confidence
that
Subject
B
was
of
the
female
sex
.
"
The
age
of
Subject
B
I
estimate
to
have
been
more
than
four
weeks
and
less
than
twelve
.
The
skeleton
in
toto
measured
22.5
inches
.
The
anterior
fontanelle
was
open
.
There
was
no
appearance
of
ossification
in
the
humeral
head
,
though
the
cuboid
was
ossified
-
"
Rufus
was
getting
into
unknown
terrain
here
.
He
had
very
little
idea
of
how
the
baby
's
age
could
have
been
estimated
.
By
the
fusion
of
joints
,
certainly
,
it
need
hardly
matter
to
him
which
ones
.
How
old
had
the
baby
been
anyway
?
Very
young
,
without
teeth
.
"
A
primary
deciduous
dentition
had
not
yet
commenced
"
,
was
no
doubt
how
the
pathologist
would
have
put
it
.
But
what
of
Subject
A's
teeth
?
That
was
primarily
how
dead
bodies
were
identified
,
by
their
teeth
.
On
the
other
hand
,
if
the
particular
person
had
never
been
missed
or
reported
missing
,
their
existence
scarcely
recorded
in
the
great
reference
log
of
National
Insurance
and
medical
cards
,
passports
and
driving
licences
,
if
the
chance
of
their
even
being
named
seemed
thin
,
what
obscure
dentist
was
going
to
rise
up
suddenly
producing
the
relevant
chart
?
A
certain
assumption
might
of
course
be
made
.
"
There
is
considerable
danger
here
of
drawing
the
conclusion
that
because
the
two
sets
of
bones
were
found
in
conjunction
and
on
the
same
date
,
they
must
have
met
their
deaths
at
the
same
time
.
Although
this
is
probably
so
,
I
am
able
to
offer
no
evidence
in
proof
of
it
.
Nor
have
I
come
upon
any
factor
to
prove
the
truth
of
another
assumption
which
may
be
made
:
to
wit
,
that
Subject
A
was
the
mother
of
Subject
B.
Experience
and
probability
point
to
this
being
so
but
that
is
all
.
"
I
am
unable
to
state
with
any
certainty
the
length
of
time
which
has
elapsed
since
the
death
of
Subject
B
or
offer
any
suggestion
as
to
the
cause
of
death
.
"
That
was
something
which
could
never
be
established
after
this
lapse
of
time
.
Unfortunate
in
a
way
,
Rufus
thought
.
It
would
be
an
ironical
stroke
if
investigations
into
the
affair
resulted
not
in
the
discovery
of
those
happenings
in
which
they
had
been
guilty
but
only
in
those
where
they
had
been
blameless
.
The
inquest
had
been
adjourned
.
No
doubt
they
were
still
digging
up
the
little
graveyard
.
Rufus
was
not
squeamish
,
he
had
not
been
one
of
those
medical
students
who
become
nauseous
at
their
first
sight
of
surgery
,
but
,
curiously
enough
he
did
not
much
like
to
think
of
all
those
odd
little
bones
,
so
alien
to
him
,
so
unidentifiable
,
being
dug
up
and
sorted
out
and
sifted
through
in
case
there
should
be
a
human
fibula
among
them
or
a
vertebra
.
Rufus
did
not
even
know
if
animal
bones
shared
the
same
names
as
those
of
humans
.
Did
dogs
have
fibulas
?
He
was
surprised
to
find
himself
shuddering
.
If
there
was
no
shot
in
or
among
the
human
remains
,
in
the
cavities
of
the
skull
for
instance
,
would
it
be
possible
to
find
it
in
the
soil
,
among
the
sand
and
gravel
and
pine
needles
?
Bird
shot
it
would
have
been
or
somewhat
larger
.
Rufus
had
only
seen
it
while
eating
partridge
which
had
been
winged
instead
of
shot
in
the
head
and
had
nearly
broken
one
of
his
teeth
on
the
tiny
ball
of
lead
.
He
imagined
gravel
being
sifted
,
all
the
particles
,
the
minute
stones
,
being
picked
over
by
some
policeman
whose
job
it
was
to
do
that
,
the
tiny
flints
laid
in
one
tray
,
the
wood
fragments
in
another
,
and
then
,
in
a
third
,
the
shot
.
He
could
remember
so
much
,
he
had
clear
pictures
of
whole
days
spent
at
Ecalpemos
,
whole
conversations
recorded
that
could
be
rerun
in
his
head
.
Why
was
it
then
that
he
could
n't
remember
where
she
had
been
shot
?
In
the
heart
or
the
head
or
the
spine
?
His
mind
blanked
over
that
and
there
was
a
complete
loss
of
recall
.
When
he
tried
and
saw
the
sky
covered
with
rushing
clouds
,
the
lawn
that
had
become
a
hay-field
,
the
cedar
's
wheeling
branches
,
the
gun
levelled
,
there
would
come
an
explosion
in
his
memory
like
the
firing
of
that
shot-gun
,
a
redness
in
front
of
his
eyes
with
splintered
edges
,
then
black-out
.
The
gun
he
could
remember
,
both
guns
.
And
the
gun-room
and
the
first
time
he
went
in
there
with
Adam
.
They
had
eaten
their
lunch
down
by
the
lake
.
Two
pork
pies
and
a
can
of
Coke
each
but
not
the
apples
which
were
imported
Granny
Smiths
and
bruised
,
and
anyway
they
had
strawberries
.
They
must
have
each
eaten
about
a
pound
of
strawberries
,
for
they
kept
going
back
to
the
fruit
cage
for
more
.
Some
time
during
the
afternoon
they
decided
not
to
go
back
but
to
stay
overnight
.
That
meant
there
was
no
hurry
,
they
could
have
lain
out
there
in
the
sun
till
the
pubs
opened
.
But
Adam
had
this
idea
of
phoning
his
mother
to
tell
her
he
would
n't
be
back
that
night
.
Rufus
would
n't
have
bothered
,
he
came
and
went
as
he
pleased
,
and
anyway
did
n't
believe
parents
should
be
pandered
to
in
this
way
.
Of
course
it
was
n't
quite
pandering
with
Adam
.
He
did
n't
want
to
get
on
worse
terms
with
his
mother
,
from
whom
he
hoped
to
get
a
loan
for
his
holiday
in
Greece
,
nor
did
he
want
the
kind
of
thing
that
might
have
happened
,
his
mother
phoning
hospitals
or
getting
the
police
because
they
could
have
had
an
accident
in
Goblander
.
As
it
turned
out
he
did
n't
make
that
phone
call
until
the
evening
and
they
found
a
call-box
outside
a
pub
in
one
of
the
villages
,
for
Great-Uncle
Hilbert
's
phone
had
been
disconnected
.
But
once
they
were
indoors
again
they
resumed
exploring
,
found
a
genuine
butler
's
pantry
with
a
lot
of
silver
in
it
packed
away
in
canteens
and
boxes
and
green
baize
,
and
opening
the
next
door
,
came
into
the
gun-room
.
Adam
,
as
a
child
,
had
been
strictly
forbidden
ever
to
go
in
there
.
Anyway
,
the
door
was
usually
kept
locked
.
Presumably
,
in
pre-Hilbert
days
,
during
Bereland
squirearchy
,
it
had
contained
an
armoury
of
weapons
,
for
all
four
walls
were
hung
with
gun
racks
.
However
,
only
two
types
of
firearms
remained
,
both
shot-guns
.
There
was
a
row
of
hooks
for
hanging
up
jackets
and
waterproofs
and
one
of
these
hung
there
still
,
Hilbert
's
old
shooting-jacket
,
tweed
,
with
leather
pads
on
the
elbows
.
A
glass
case
on
the
windowsill
contained
a
fat
stuffed
trout
,
another
,
on
the
circular
table
,
a
turtle
-
this
certainly
not
of
English
provenance
.
The
front
half
of
a
fox
,
paws
and
all
,
its
rear
end
replaced
by
a
shield-shaped
slab
of
polished
wood
,
appeared
to
be
leaping
out
of
the
wall
just
below
the
picture
rail
,
in
the
manner
of
a
circus
dog
emerging
from
a
paper
hoop
.
"
Those
are
n't
the
sort
of
things
you
shoot
,
though
,
are
they
?
"
Rufus
had
asked
.
"
You
most
definitely
do
n't
shoot
foxes
.
"
Adam
said
this
in
such
a
snooty
,
lord-of-the-manor
way
that
Rufus
yelled
with
laughter
.
He
took
one
of
the
guns
,
the
twelve
bore
,
from
the
wall
and
Adam
had
another
go
at
him
,
this
time
for
pointing
it
in
his
direction
.
"
It
's
not
loaded
,
for
God
's
sake
.
"
"
Never
mind
.
You
do
n't
point
guns
at
people
.
"
It
appeared
then
that
Adam
had
actually
been
out
shooting
the
last
time
he
was
here
.
He
had
only
been
fifteen
and
had
been
given
the
four-ten
,
the
so-called
lady
's
gun
,
which
Rufus
gathered
had
rather
gone
against
the
grain
.
Since
then
he
had
often
recalled
what
Adam
said
next
,
had
taken
the
gun
from
him
and
remarked
that
it
was
a
pump-action
shot-gun
.
"
What
does
that
mean
?
"
"
You
do
n't
have
to
keep
reloading
.
It
's
got
a
repeating
action
.
You
do
n't
have
to
put
a
cartridge
in
each
time
before
you
fire
.
"
And
Rufus
,
who
did
n't
mind
appearing
ingenuous
in
this
area
,
said
,
"
I
thought
all
firearms
worked
like
that
.
"
One
of
the
drawers
in
the
pine
cabinet
was
stocked
with
cartridges
,
red
ones
and
blue
ones
which
Adam
said
indicated
the
size
of
the
shot
they
contained
.
"
That
's
amazing
,
me
inheriting
a
couple
of
guns
as
well
.
We
might
even
get
some
shooting
.
"
"
Not
in
June
,
squire
.
Even
I
know
that
.
"
Was
that
the
first
hint
,
no
more
than
a
joke
really
,
that
they
might
stay
at
Wyvis
Hall
,
that
they
might
live
there
?
And
Adam
had
said
:
"
I
did
n't
mean
now
.
"
"
I
thought
–you
were
going
to
sell
the
place
.
"
Adam
did
n't
say
any
more
.
They
went
back
down
the
garden
and
after
that
out
to
a
couple
of
pubs
where
they
drank
a
lot
and
Rufus
had
to
drive
back
to
Wyvis
Hall
with
one
eye
closed
on
account
of
getting
double
vision
.
They
slept
it
off
,
not
getting
up
till
around
eleven
next
morning
,
Rufus
in
the
principal
guest
room
,
Adam
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
in
what
he
christened
the
Pincushion
Room
because
it
had
a
picture
on
the
wall
of
St
Sebastian
stuck
full
of
arrows
.
Rufus
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
a
man
trimming
the
grass
round
one
of
the
rose
beds
with
a
pair
of
long-handled
shears
.
He
was
elderly
,
bald
,
very
thin
,
wearing
a
striped
shirt
of
the
kind
that
have
detachable
collars
.
It
was
the
sound
of
his
clipping
which
had
woken
Rufus
up
.
The
sun
was
blazing
down
and
there
was
n't
a
spot
of
shade
anywhere
till
you
came
to
the
wood
below
the
lake
.
Rufus
,
who
had
n't
much
appreciation
of
nature
usually
,
nevertheless
found
himself
gazing
in
something
like
wonderment
at
all
the
roses
,
yellow
and
pink
and
apricot
and
dark
red
,
a
hedge
of
white
ones
,
a
cascade
of
peach-red
that
covered
a
pergola
.
The
man
with
the
shears
laid
them
down
on
the
grass
,
took
a
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
,
made
a
knot
in
each
of
its
four
corners
and
placed
this
improvised
sun-hat
on
his
head
.
Rufus
had
never
seen
anyone
do
that
before
,
though
he
had
seen
it
in
pictures
on
seaside
postcards
.
He.was
entranced
.
He
put
on
his
shorts
and
his
sandals
and
went
down
.
By
the
time
he
got
outside
Adam
was
already
there
,
telling
the
man
in
the
handkerchief
hat
that
he
did
n't
want
him
to
come
any
more
,
he
was
going
to
sell
the
house
.
"
This
old
garden
'll
go
to
rack
and
ruin
then
.
I
been
coming
down
here
watering
most
nights
.
"
"
That
's
not
my
problem
,
"
said
Adam
.
"
The
people
who
buy
it
will
have
to
handle
that
.
"
"
It

The
gardener
opened
his
shears
and
wiped
the
grass
clippings
off
the
blades
with
his
forefinger

But
it
's
not

Mr
Verne-Smith

me
up

end

April
,
so
that
's
seven
weeks
you
owe
me

let's
say
six
and
a
half

Adam
looked
rather
shattered
.

to

"
True
,
but
I

Adam
could
n't
.
He
did
n't
try
.
In
the
cagey
,
suspicious
way
he
sometimes
spoke
he
said
:
"
How
much
in
fact
would
it
be
?
"
"
I
come
twice
a
week
at
a
pound
a
time
,
so
that
's
thirteen
,
say
,
and
then
there
's
all
the
times
I
've
come
with
me
cans
.
Fifteen
I
reckon
would
cover
it
.
"
It
was
ludicrously
less
than
Rufus
had
expected
.
For
all
that
labour
it
was
ridiculous
.
But
this
was
the
country
,
this
was
horticulture
,
and
they
ordered
things
differently
there
.
He
and
Adam
went
into
the
house
where
they
managed
to
scrounge
up
fifteen
quid
between
the
two
of
them
,
leaving
them
with
just
enough
to
cover
the
petrol
for
Goblander
to
get
home
on
.
Adam
paid
the
man
and
he
went
off
on
a
bicycle
,
still
wearing
the
knotted
handkerchief
on
his
head
.
It
was
only
after
he
had
gone
that
they
realized
they
had
never
asked
his
name
or
where
he
lived
.
"
You
could
have
kept
him
on
for
two
quid
a
week
.
It
's
nothing
.
"
"
I
have
n't
got
two
quid
a
week
.
I
'm
skint
.
"
And
it
was
lack
of
money
that
stopped
them
going
away
.
He
,
Rufus
,
could
have
got
just
about
enough
together
for
the
petrol
en
route
and
maybe
his
own
food
.
If
Adam
had
had
an
equal
amount
they
would
have
managed
.
In
another
year
,
at
almost
any
other
time
,
Adam
would
have
touched
his
father
or
more
probably
his
mother
for
a
loan
,
but
in
June
1976
his
father
was
barely
speaking
to
him
,
and
his
mother
would
have
been
scared
to
go
against
her
husband
.
Of
course
if
Adam
had
invited
his
parents
to
make
themselves
at
home
at
Wyvis
Hall
,
use
it
as
a
hotel
,
while
he
was
away
,
they
would
have
lent
him
any
amount
,
but
that
was
the
last
thing
Adam
would
have
done
.
He
did
ask
his
sister
for
money
.
Bridget
had
been
one
of
those
teenagers
who
work
all
through
their
school
holidays
in
restaurants
or
in
shops
or
cleaning
houses
and
she
always
had
cash
.
But
she
would
not
lend
him
any
.
She
was
saving
up
to
go
skiing
the
next
January
and
she
knew
there
was
n't
much
chance
of
Adam
repaying
a
loan
by
then
.
It
was
ironical
that
Adam
,
who
was
the
owner
of
that
big
house
and
all
that
land
and
the
contents
of
the
house
,
nevertheless
went
down
to
Nunes
the
second
time
with
less
than
a
fiver
in
his
pocket
.
And
that
was
everything
he
had
.
Instead
of
Greece
they
went
to
Wyvis
Hall
because
Adam
was
broke
and
Mary
was
close
to
broke
because
that
first
time
it
had
been
so
beautiful
and
peaceful
and
private
there
that
you
could
hardly
see
what
advantages
Greece
would
have
had
over
it
.
They
had
intended
to
stay
a
week
.
Rufus
had
suggested
to
Adam
that
he
sell
something
out
of
the
house
,
a
piece
of
china
or
some
silver
.
There
were
almost
more
antique
and
second-hand
shops
in
some
of
those
villages
than
there
were
houses
.
He
had
counted
six
in
the
place
where
they
had
gone
to
the
pub
.
They
talked
about
it
on
the
way
down
in
Goblander
.
It
was
funny
how
good
Adam
had
been
at
naming
things
,
the
rooms
in
the
house
,
the
house
itself
even
,
or
at
naming
the
idea
of
it
,
the
concept
,
Ecalpemos
.
Goblander
was
not
just
an
anagram
on
old
banger
,
it
really
expressed
the
way
that
decrepit
old
van
had
of
gobbling
up
petrol
as
it
chugged
through
the
countryside
making
awful
noises
because
it
needed
a
new
silencer
.
"
You
'll
never
even
get
near
Greece
in
this
,
"
said
Mary
.
"
It
'll
just
collapse
and
give
up
the
ghost
somewhere
in
France
.
I
'm
warning
you
.
"
Her
father
was
a
life
peer
who
had
held
some
sort
of
office
under
a
Labour
government
.
It
must
have
been
the
boarding-school
she
had
been
to
which
determined
her
voice
,
affected
,
sharp
,
shrill
.
She
found
fault
a
lot
.
The
car
was
wrong
,
Rufus
's
clothes
were
wrong
or
funny
or
somehow
unsuitable
,
he
smoked
too
much
,
he
was
too
fond
of
wine
and
his
whole
lifestyle
left
much
to
be
desired
.
She
started
on
Adam
for
taking
up
that
shameful
suggestion
about
selling
what
she
called
the
family
silver
.
How
dreadful
!
What
a
desecration
!
He
ought
to
have
a
feeling
of
reverence
for
the
beautiful
things
his
great-uncle
had
entrusted
to
him
.
"
He
's
not
coming
back
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
to
see
how
I
've
discharged
my
duties
.
"
"
He
'll
turn
in
his
grave
.
"
"
No
,
there
'll
just
be
a
small
upheaval
in
his
ashes
.
"
He
told
her
Great-Uncle
Hilbert
's
ashes
were
the
contents
of
an
urn-shaped
Crown
Derby
sweets-jar
that
stood
on
the
drawing-room
mantelpiece
.
Maybe
she
believed
him
,
for
Rufus
had
once
caught
her
lifting
the
lid
and
looking
into
the
jar
at
the
wood
ash
Adam
had
scraped
up
from
the
site
of
the
handkerchief
man
's
last
bonfire
.
Mary
was
rather
difficult
but
she
was
also
just
about
the
most
beautiful
girl
Rufus
had
ever
come
across
.
It
gratified
him
to
be
seen
in
her
company
.
He
had
always
been
a
bit
that
way
had
Rufus
,
manifestly
to
be
seen
to
be
doing
all
right
for
himself
,
successful
,
forging
ahead
,
accompanied
by
the
best-looking
girl
possible
.
Mary
was
spectacular
to
look
at
and
her
own
knowledge
that
she
was
made
her
capricious
and
difficult
,
expecting
the
best
of
everything
.
All
that
was
her
due
because
she
looked
like
the
young
Elizabeth
Taylor
,
had
dark
brown
curly
hair
nearly
to
her
waist
,
large
,
dark
blue
eyes
,
creamy
velvet
skin
and
a
wonderful
figure
.
It
was
20
June
when
they
went
back
,
all
Goblander
's
windows
open
,
the
weather
being
perfect
the
way
you
expected
it
to
be
that
summer
,
as
if
it
were
southern
Europe
where
you
woke
up
each
morning
to
sunshine
and
unclouded
skies
.
By
that
time
,
as
Adam
said
,
you
would
actually
have
been
shocked
if
the
temperature
had
dropped
or
a
shower
of
rain
fallen
.
"
It
makes
you
think
there
might
n't
be
an
awful
lot
of
point
in
going
to
Greece
,
"
he
said
.
"
I
mean
,
this
could
be
the
best
summer
ever
and
we
'd
miss
it
.
It
's
always
like
this
in
Greece
.
"
They
'd
brought
food
with
them
,
quite
a
lot
of
food
.
Adam
said
the
first
thing
would
be
to
get
old
Hilbert
's
fridge
going
.
Of
course
it
was
his
own
fridge
but
he
was
still
in
the
habit
of
speaking
as
if
,
as
Mary
had
inferred
,
his
great-uncle
might
return
.
It
must
have
been
a
strange
experience
for
him
,
Rufus
had
thought
,
knowing
he
owned
all
sorts
of
things
but
not
knowing
quite
what
or
where
they
were
.
They
were
the
sort
of
things
too
which
the
parent
generation
owned
,
those
old
people
that
Adam
,
until
Rufus
laughed
at
him
,
had
inadvertently
called
the
grown-ups
:
sheets
and
blankets
and
knives
and
forks
and
pots
and
pans
and
more
complicated
appurtenances
of
living
that
if
one
ever
thought
about
at
all
one
supposed
one
would
have
to
get
together
for
oneself
eventually
.
Someone
else
had
got
it
together
for
Adam
and
there
it
all
was
.
They
found
some
sheets
in
a
walk-in
cupboard
,
linen
ones
with
LVS
embroidered
on
them
.
The
sheets
felt
a
bit
damp
so
Mary
spread
them
out
on
the
terrace
in
the
sun
to
dry
.
They
ate
out
there
too
and
drank
one
of
the
bottles
of
wine
they
had
brought
.
It
was
an
amazing
amount
of
wine
they
got
through
down
at
Wyvis
Hall
,
and
not
only
wine
.
But
that
first
day
they
had
only
been
able
to
afford
two
bottles
of
Anjou
rose
.
Later
on
they
went
all
over
the
house
,
assessing
what
they
might
be
able
to
sell
,
finding
out
just
what
Adam
's
inheritance
amounted
to
.
Rufus
had
been
astonished
by
the
quantities
of
junk
in
that
house
,
the
ornaments
and
knick-knacks
and
stuff
like
vases
and
candlesticks
and
ashtrays
and
glass
and
brass
that
Hilbert
Verne-Smith
and
his
wife
had
accumulated
over
the
years
.
Mary
got
stroppy
about
it
and
said
it
was
wrong
what
they
were
doing
,
it
was
a
desecration
.
But
Adam
had
retorted
quite.reasonably
that
it
was
his
now
,
did
n't
she
understand
that
?
It
was
as
much
his
to
do
as
he
liked
with
as
the
sandals
on
his
feet
and
the
change
from
that
fiver
he
had
in
his
pocket
after
buying
the
rose
.
And
then
Mary
said
she
felt
as
if
Hilbert
were
there
with
them
as
they
rifled
through
chests
and
drawers
and
cupboards
,
she
could
feel
his
presence
standing
behind
them
,
looking
over
her
shoulder
.
By
then
it
was
dark
,
it
was
night
time
.
And
at
Wyvis
Hall
,
below
the
woods
and
above
the
river
,
with
the
nearest
road
half
a
mile
away
and
the
nearest
house
twice
as
far
as
that
,
total
silence
prevailed
.
The
sky
was
clear
,
the
colour
of
a
very
dark
blue
jewel
,
and
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
the
stars
were
mirrored
.
The
house
was
full
of
moths
because
they
had
left
the
doors
and
windows
open
after
they
put
the
lights
on
.
Mary
screamed
when
a
bat
flew
close
to
her
,
she
said
bats
got
in
your
hair
,
a
bat
had
got
into
the
hair
of
some
relative
of
hers
and
bitten
her
scalp
.
Mary
's
scream
sounded
particularly
loud
in
that
dark
silence
.
There
was
a
loud
echo
in
the
grounds
of
Wyvis
Hall
,
Mary
's
scream
ringing
back
from
off
the
wood
and
walls
and
starry
waters
,
and
Rufus
,
a
town
dweller
who
had
never
spent
much
time
in
the
countryside
,
expected
alarmed
or
annoyed
people
to
arrive
or
the
disconnected
phone
to
start
shrilling
with
complaints
.
Of
course
nothing
happened
.
They
could
all
have
screamed
the
place
down
,
Mary
could
have
been
bitten
to
death
by
bats
,
and
no
one
would
have
come
.
That
was
part
of
the
trouble
,
that
was
how
it
was
that
events
were
set
in
motion
.
If
Wyvis
Hall
had
been
less
isolated
,
less
silent
-
Rufus
had
come
a
long
way
since
the
Goblander
days
and
the
car
he
got
into
to
drive
himself
to
the
hospital
he
attended
two
mornings
a
week
was
a
Mercedes
,
not
yet
a
year
old
.
At
the
garage
where
he
bought
petrol
they
offered
him
a
complimentary
sherry
glass
because
he
had
bought
more
than
thirty
litres
.
Rufus
refused
.
He
already
had
two
of
the
things
clinking
about
on
the
back
seat
.
But
the
sight
of
the
glass
took
him
back
into
the
past
again
,
the
past
which
he
believed
he
had
exorcised
but
was
now
fetched
back
in
fragments
and
longer
scenarios
by
every
possible
association
.
He
had
sat
in
that
locked
room
talking
,
therapist
and
patient
both
,
had
talked
it
over
and
over
.
To
the
site
of
his
trauma
he
had
returned
and
re-lived
it
.
He
might
just
as
well
not
have
bothered
,
for
it
was
there
still
,
it
would
be
there
for
ever
,
unless
one
day
they
found
how
to
cut
memory
out
of
the
brain
with
a
scalpel
.
On
the
back
seat
the
two
sherry
glasses
clinked
as
Rufus
took
a
left
turn
rather
too
sharply
.
What
they
had
eventually
decided
to
sell
before
they
went
to
bed
that
night
(
or
the
following
morning
really
)
were
Great-Uncle
Hilbert
's
do–en
Waterford
sherry
glasses
.
As
Adam
said
,
none
of
them
drank
sherry
and
he
did
n't
know
anyone
under
fifty
who
did
.
Having
wandered
about
all
over
the
house
,
they
had
ended
up
in
the
dining
room
where
the
cabinet
full
of
glass
was
.
In
another
cupboard
they
found
half
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
a
dribble
of
brandy
in
the
bottom
of
a
Courvoisier
bottle
.
There
had
been
something
extraordinarily
delightful
and
exhilarating
about
sitting
at
that
big
oval
mahogany
table
drinking
whisky
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
The
moon
had
come
up
and
laid
a
greenish
iridescence
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
.
It
was
so
bright
it
made
the
stars
disappear
.
They
had
to
close
the
window
because
of
the
insects
.
Then
they
turned
out
the
lights
,
the
great
brass
chandelier
with
its
false
candles
,
and
the
moon
's
lemony
radiance
lay
as
still
as
cloths
draped
over
the
shining
wood
.
Adam
set
the
twelve
sherry
glasses
that
were
cut
in
a
greek
key
pattern
round
their
rims
in
the
middle
of
the
moonlight
and
said
he
would
put
them
in
a
box
tomorrow
and
try
to
sell
them
in
Sudbury
to
the
man
who
had
the
antique
shop
in
Gainsborough
Street
that
they
had
passed
.
There
had
been
a
kind
of
innocence
about
them
at
that
stage
,
Rufus
thought
.
On
one
level
they
were
just
marking
time
,
spending
a
few
days
in
the
country
at
a
friend
's
house
.
On
another
they
felt
(
as
Mary
put
it
)
like
burglars
,
prowling
about
the
house
,
discovering
treasures
,
half-expecting
the
true
owner
to
return
and
surprise
them
.
"
Suppose
old
Hilbert
's
face
were
to
appear
at
the
window
now
,
"
Adam
had
said
as
they
went
up
the
bask
stairs
to
bed
.
There
was
a
window
at
the
top
,
on
the
landing
,
but
outside
there
was
only
the
blue
jewel
night
.
They
had
all
slept
heavily
,
the
sleep
if
not
of
the
just
,
of
the
innocent
and
artless
.
None
of
them
doubted
that
they
would
eventually
get
to
Greece
.
In
those
early
days
,
that
last
week
of
June
,
it
was
merely
a
matter
of
raising
enough
money
.
Not
that
this
had
been
easy
.
The
Sudbury
man
was
not
forthcoming
,
he
had
been
suspicious
,
wanting
all
sorts
of
information
about
them
and
the
glasses
.
"
He
thinks
you
've
nicked
them
,
does
n't
he
?
"
said
Mary
,
who
had
n't
come
in
but
stayed
outside
in
Goblander
.
"
And
of
course
he
would
.
I
mean
just
look
at
you
!
"
Adam
's
cut-off
jeans
with
the
fringed
hems
,
she
meant
,
and
his
yellow
and
red
headband
that
he
insisted
on
calling
a
fillet
as
if
it
were
a
bit
of
fish
.
And
their
long
hair
and
bare
feet
.
"
You
reckon
I
should
put
on
one
of
Hilbert
's
suits
,
do
you
?
"
Adam
said
.
He
never
did
that
.
Instead
they
drove
into
Hadleigh
and
found
an
antique
shop
man
who
offered
to
drive
to
Wyvis
Hall
and
give
Adam
a
valuation
for
some
of
the
furniture
,
the
chandeliers
and
the
ornaments
.
Two
days
later
he
actually
came
,
an
oldish
man
,
at
least
sixty
,
and
valued
two
of
the
cabinets
as
worth
£500
apiece
.
When
Adam
heard
that
,
he
did
n't
want
to
sell
,
he
was
sure
they
must
therefore
be
worth
far
more
.
The
man
bought
a
brass
lantern
and
two
little
tables
with
the
surfaces
carved
with
flowers
and
fruit
and
the
sherry
glasses
,
giving
Adam
£150
for
the
lot
.
Rufus
could
not
remember
the
man
's
name
,
only
that
he
had
been
the
second
visitor
to
Wyvis
Hall
,
the
gardener
being
the
first
.
Would
he
remember
?
If
still
alive
,
he
would
be
in
his
seventies
by
now
.
He
had
a
confused
impression
of
coming
into
the
dining
room
while
the
man
was
there
and
hearing
him
rather
grudgingly
assess
the
value
of
the
glass
cabinet
.
The
man
had
said
good
morning
and
Rufus
had
said
hallo
and
had
returned
to
the
task
he
and
Mary
were
embarked
on
,
covering
the
flagstones
of
the
terrace
with
quilts
from
the
bedrooms
.
The
terrace
faced
south
and
got
the
full
sun
,
so
it
was
too
hot
to
be
out
there
by
day
,
but
in
the
evenings
and
at
night
it
was
wonderful
.
They
fetched
a
lightly
padded
patchwork
quilt
from
the
Centaur
Room
,
a
pink
candlewick
from
the
Room
Without
a
Name
,
two
of
white
cotton
from
the
Room
of
Astonishment
and
a
counterpane
of
heavy
yellow
satin
they
found
in
a
cupboard
in
the
Pincushion
Room
.
Mary
arranged
some
pillows
out
there
and
cushions
from
the
drawing
room
and
by
the
time
they
were
finished
the
antiques
man
had
gone
.
Leaving
them
with
£150
.
So
that
evening
they
went
out
to
spend
some
of
it
.
Had
they
been
noticed
and
noted
as
they
drove
through
the
village
of
Nunes
?
Rufus
had
always
heard
that
nothing
can
go
on
in
a
village
without
the
gossips
knowing
.
Perhaps
this
would
apply
if
they
had
walked
along
that
village
street
or
sat
on
the
green
or
drunk
in
the
local
,
but
they
had
not
.
For
some
reason
they
had
not
much
liked
the
look
of
this
pub
,
called
the
Fir
Tree
,
and
though
he
had
slowed
a
bit
as
they
came
to
it
,
they
had
not
stopped
.
He
had
seldom
been
to
the
village
and
only
once
on
foot
but
he
could
remember
the
layout
of
it
with
surprising
clarity
.
A
church
that
stood
upon
a
grassy
hill
and
to
which
you
mounted
by
a
flight
of
steep
stone
stairs
.
An
avenue
of
yew
trees
.
Behind
it
one
of
those
screens
of
elms
,
all
dead
even
by
then
of
Dutch
elm
disease
.
A
village
street
of
houses
and
cottages
,
a
garage
,
a
grocer
,
but
not
a
single
antique
shop
.
The
green
an
isosceles
triangle
without
a
tree
to
it
,
but
trees
around
the
pub
,
the
same
kind
as
in
Adam
's
pine
wood
,
Rufus
supposed
,
or
very
like
,
which
the
licensee
or
the
brewery
had
probably
thought
its
name
required
.
There
was
the
inevitable
council
estate
,
the
houses
painted
pale
green
,
blue
,
pink
,
as
in
some
child
's
drawing
,
and
then
,
round
a
bend
in
the
lane
where
you
might
have
expected
open
fields
,
half
a
dozen
houses
of
1950s
or
'60s
provenance
,
lavishly
appointed
,
glamorously
gardened
,
with
big
garages
and
big
cars
outside
them
.
"
Hampstead
Garden
Suburb
comes
to
Suffolk
,
"
Adam
had
said
.
Later
on
they
had
seen
the
coypu
man
's
van
parked
on
the
front
driveway
of
one
of
those
houses
.
And
they
had
had
a
discussion
about
it
,
speculating
as
to
whether
he
actually
lived
there
or
was
there
to
kill
something
,
rats
,
moles
,
any
sort
of
infestation
.
Snobbish
Rufus
had
not
thought
it
possible
for
someone
like
that
to
live
there
,
but
why
not
,
after
all
?
There
was
money
to
be
made
out
of
the
destruction
of
pests
in
a
country
place
.
Rufus
had
an
out-patients
'
clinic
and
then
a
ward
round
,
in
the
afternoon
a
very
frightened
woman
to
see
in
Wimpole
Street
,
a
woman
who
needed
his
kind
reassurance
,
his
urbane
ways
,
the
proffered
cigarette
,
the
support
.
His
first
cigarette
of
the
day
he
smoked
while
he
waited
,
extinguishing
it
two
minutes
before
she
was
shown
in
and
he
had
to
tell
her
that
her
cervical
smear
had
shown
pre-cancerous
signs
.
Who
would
reassure
him
?
Comfort
him
?
No
one
,
he
thought
,
and
despised
himself
for
what
was
to
him
an
unnatural
need
.
The
police
would
not
necessarily
assume
that
the
bones
in
the
graveyard
were
of
people
who
had
lived
at
Wyvis
Hall
,
nor
that
those
who
had
brought
about
their
deaths
had
lived
there
.
But
it
was
likely
.
It
was
most
probable
.
The
existence
of
the
cemetery
was
not
generally
known
and
on
the
lane
side
of
the
pine
wood
the
trees
were
separated
from
the
grass
verge
by
a
dose-boarded
fence
.
They
would
ask
a
lot
of
questions
in
the
village
.
They
would
make
enquiries
at
Pytle
Farm
and
the
house
called
the
Mill
in
the
Pytle
.
By
some
means
they
would
discover
all
the
people
who
were
likely
to
have
called
at
Wyvis
Hall
in
the
capacity
of
tradesmen
or
service
operatives
:
dustmen
,
meter
readers
,
gardeners
,
antique
dealers
,
perhaps
-
why
not
?
-
the
coypu
man
.
Adam
would
be
questioned
,
was
possibly
being
questioned
at
this
moment
.
Unless
he
had
changed
a
lot
he
would
not
make
a
good
impression
.
Had
the
time
come
to
forget
the
promise
they
had
made
each
other
,
the
guarantee
they
had
given
never
to
meet
or
speak
?
Rufus
reached
for
the
blue
phone
directory
and
turned
to
the
V's
,
to
Verne-Smith-Duchini
,
and
had
actually
begun
to
dial
when
his
patient
was
announced
.
He
put
the
receiver
back
and
created
,
forcing
his
lips
to
perform
,
a
wide
smile
.
The
lake
water
was
clear
and
cool
,
not
cold
.
Weeks
of
sunshine
had
taken
off
the
chill
.
Soon
after
they
got
up
-
which
was
always
late
,
which
was
lunchtime
-
he
and
Rufus
went
in
swimming
,
keeping
their
feet
off
the
gravelly
or
slimy
bottom
and
their
arms
clear
of
the
blanket
weed
which
was
like
green
hair
.
The
lily
leaves
lay
flat
on
the
surface
,
their
flowers
waxen
crimson
and
palest
yellow
,
their
stems
tough
,
glutinous
,
slippery
,
a
tangle
of
entrails
.
"
Reminds
me
of
the
duodenum
,
"
said
Rufus
,
yanking
out
a
long
slimy
stem
and
lassoing
Adam
with
it
,
catching
his
neck
in
a
halter
of
living
rope
.
They
grappled
together
,
the
way
schoolboys
do
,
but
they
were
n't
schoolboys
and
Adam
was
suddenly
aware
of
Rufus
's
body
under
the
water
,
his
hard
muscles
and
smooth
skin
,
legs
briefly
intertwined
with
his
.
And
when
Rufus
's
arms
grabbed
him
from
behind
,
ostensibly
of
course
just
to
duck
him
under
the
surface
,
he
found
himself
resisting
in
a
way
that
Rufus
recognized
as
real
resistance
and
let
him
go
.
And
Rufus
knew
why
,
grinning
a
little
as
their
eyes
met
.
He
swam
away
and
Adam
swam
away
and
very
soon
after
that
they
came
out
of
the
lake
and
went
back
to
Mary
on
the
terrace
.
A
disturbing
experience
it
had
been
,
exciting
and
confusing
.
Adam
had
not
known
he
carried
within
his
mind
a
directory
of
the
forbidden
.
Selling
what
he
still
thought
of
-
in
spite
of
what
he
said
to
Mary
-
as
Hilbert
's
things
,
appeared
only
on
the
perimeter
of
it
,
in
an
area
of
doubt
.
Money
they
had
to
have
.
For
the
rest
of
the
time
they
were
there
money
did
not
exactly
overshadow
them
but
the
pressing
need
for
it
was
always
there
,
it
was
always
in
their
minds
.
And
Mary
's
condemnation
was
not
enough
to
keep
him
from
succumbing
.
He
had
let
the
dealer
from
Hadleigh
come
,
a
man
called
Evans
or
Owens
,
one
of
those
Welsh
names
,
and
sold
him
a
brass
lantern
and
two
little
carved
tables
and
the
sherry
glasses
.
The
money
he
gave
them
they
had
meant
to
use
for
the
Greek
trip
but
it
was
more
than
they
expected
and
they
had
gone
on
a
shopping
,
then
a
drinking
,
spree
with
it
.
Also
Goblander
had
needed
a
new
exhaust
system
and
they
had
that
done
immediately
,
not
in
the
local
Nunes
garage
though
but
at
a
big
,
impersonal
place
in
Colchester
.
Rufus
had
thought
Goblander
needed
a
thorough
overhaul
and
the
mechanic
confirmed
this
,
adding
that
it
would
cost
him
.
The
bill
would
be
around
£75
but
,
as
Mary
had
said
,
the
van
would
n't
get
as
far
as
Calais
in
its
present
state
.
Next
day
they
had
collected
the
rejuvenated
Goblander
,
catching
one
of
the
rare
buses
to
Colchester
and
taking
all
day
about
it
.
The
cost
of
the
service
was
nearer
£85
than
£75
and
they
spent
a
further
£50
on
food
and
drink
.
Drink
mostly
.
Adam
drank
very
little
these
days
.
It
nauseated
him
and
wakened
him
in
the
night
with
a
palpitating
heart
.
He
had
been
better
able
to
tolerate
it
ten
years
ago
,
but
then
he
had
drunk
alcohol
to
be
like
other
people
and
to
impress
,
not
because
he
liked
it
.
Rufus
was
different
.
Rufus
had
a
great
capacity
and
could
metabolize
(
as
he
put
it
)
large
quantities
of
spirits
and
larger
amounts
of
wine
.
It
was
not
unusual
for
him
,
unaided
,
to
drink
two
bottles
of
wine
in
as
many
hours
.
But
he
was
wrong
when
he
said
it
had
no
effect
on
him
.
The
effects
were
very
apparent
,
though
they
were
not
the
common
ones
of
slurred
speech
and
unsteadiness
and
loss
of
memory
.
Rufus
used
to
say
that
if
left
to
themselves
most
men
would
live
on
meat
and
cake
.
They
might
eat
fruit
and
vegetables
and
dairy
products
but
that
was
for
their
health
,
not
because
they
liked
them
.
It
was
versions
of
meat
and
cake
that
the
three
of
them
bought
to
store
in
Hilbert
's
-
no
,
his
-
fridge
,
and
they
bought
crisps
and
chocolate
bars
and
a
crate
full
of
wines
and
spirits
.
He
was
a
sybarite
or
an
Epicurean
,
Adam
thought
;
relishing
words
,
but
Epicurean
sounded
better
,
less
pejorative
.
No
one
drank
the
spirits
but
Rufus
,
and
Adam
suspected
that
he
drank
more
than
he
let
on
about
,
probably
keeping
a
private
bottle
somewhere
.
"
I
do
n't
see
any
point
in
self-denial
,
"
he
used
to
say
.
"
My
father
says
being
denied
things
refines
the
character
.
"
Rufus
grinned
,
for
of
course
Adam
had
told
him
all
about
Hilbert
's
will
.
"
He
should
know
,
"
he
said
.
Adam
suspected
that
these
days
Rufus
might
be
quite
fastidious
about
wine
,
a
wine
snob
even
,
the
kind
that
savours
bouquets
and
talks
about
nice
little
domestic
burgundies
and
so
forth
,
but
in
those
days
it
was
plonk
he
wanted
.
So
they
bought
the
cheapest
obtainable
in
order
to
get
more
of
it
,
Nicolas
,
and
stuff
called
Hirondelle
.
"
I
shall
have
to
sell
the
Gainsborough
next
,
"
Adam
said
.
Of
course
it
turned
out
not
to
be
a
Gainsborough
,
in
spite
of
what
Evans
or
Owens
had
said
.
Having
secured
the
tables
and
the
glasses
,
he
had
peered
at
the
dark
discoloured
oil
of
an
elderly
cleric
in
a
shovel
hat
and
opined
that
this
was
the
work
of
"
our
local
genius
"
.
Asked
to
explain
,
he
said
he
meant
Gainsborough
,
who
had
been
born
in
Sudbury
.
Had
n't
they
seen
the
statue
of
him
in
the
Market
Place
where
he
stood
with
his
palette
,
apparently
painting
the
pub
and
King
's
the
grocer
's
?
They
took
the
painting
to
Sudbury
to
get
an
expert
opinion
and
there
the
signature
at
the
bottom
of
the
canvas
was
pointed
out
to
them
,
that
of
one
C.
Prebble
.
So
they
took
it
back
to
Wyvis
Hall
and
hung
it
up
again
and
then
they
lay
out
on
the
terrace
in
the
sun
,
eating
rump
steak
and
potato
crisps
and
drinking
Hirondelle
rose
.
They
used
Hilbert
's
wine
glasses
because
none
of
them
could
tolerate
drinking
from
plastic
or
cartons
but
they
ate
off
paper
plates
of
which
they
had
bought
a
hundred
.
It
must
have
been
that
day
or
the
next
,
Adam
thought
,
that
he
or
one
of
them
,
surely
he
,
had
first
suggested
the
commune
idea
.
But
not
then
,
not
yet
.
He
had
brought
with
him
reading
that
was
expected
of
him
during
this
vacation
,
works
on
sociology
and
on
linguistics
and
some
where
these
two
studies
converged
,
but
these
were
not
the
sort
of
books
one
much
wanted
to
read
under
the
hot
sun
and
the
influence
of
wine
.
Instead
he
read
Hilbert
's
books
,
notably
selections
from
a
shelf
of
classic
pornography
,
not
in
any
way
hidden
,
the
books
not
concealed
under
plain
covers
,
but
there
on
display
for
anyone
to
find
.
Adam
rather
admired
his
great-uncle
for
this
.
There
was
Guillaume
Apollinaire
and
Henry
Miller
,
Pisanus
Fraxi
and
My
Secret
Life
,
Frank
Harris
's
My
Life
and
Loves
and
a
dozen
others
.
That
afternoon
Adam
,
knowing
it
was
not
the
wisest
thing
to
be
doing
in
his
celibate
situation
,
lay
on
the
terrace
reading
Fanny
Hill
.
Rufus
and
Mary
lay
quite
near
him
on
a
candlewick
bedspread
Rufus
had
found
in
one
of
the
spare
bedrooms
.
They
had
been
for
some
ten
minutes
locked
in
a
close
embrace
,
the
length
of
their
bodies
pressed
together
.
Sweat
was
running
down
Rufus
's
back
,
between
his
rather
sharp
shoulder
blades
.
In
spite
of
being
so
fair
,
his
skin
had
taken
on
quite
a
deep
tan
in
the
few
days
they
had
been
there
.
Adam
had
tried
not
to
look
but
now
he
could
not
help
looking
.
What
he
had
feared
would
happen
was
happening
now
,
though
the
feeling
he
had
was
not
of
being
in
any
way
rejected
,
nor
was
it
embarrassment
.
It
was
simply
a
breathless
,
increasing
,
pulse-hammering
sexual
longing
.
The
two
of
them
slid
a
little
apart
,
Rufus
rolling
on
to
his
back
so
that
his
pronounced
erection
showed
,
like
a
great
clenched
fist
under
his
black
trunks
.
He
kept
his
head
turned
towards
Mary
,
though
,
as
between
parted
lips
they
licked
the
tips
of
each
other
's
tongues
.
Adam
found
Rufus
's
great
endowment
as
disturbing
as
Mary
's
naked
breasts
which
lay
round
and
creamy
,
soft
and
passive
yet
with
hard
,
pointed
nipples
,
between
the
open
sides
of
her
blouse
.
He
turned
his
head
away
,
pressed
forehead
and
eyes
hard
down
into
the
covers
of
Fanny
Hill
.
After
a
while
he
heard
the
others
move
,
heard
Rufus
take
a
great
slurp
of
wine
before
they
padded
barefoot
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
to
the
Centaur
Room
.
When
Adam
was
about
eight
his
father
had
told
him
masturbating
gave
you
scurvy
.
Saying
scurvy
was
caused
by
a
lack
of
vitamin
C
was
just
a
blind
,
put
about
by
doctors
and
nutritionists
who
ought
to
know
better
.
Most
of
the
people
you
saw
with
false
teeth
had
masturbated
when
young
,
it
was
a
well-known
fact
,
only
there
was
a
conspiracy
between
dentists
and
what
Lewis
called
the
vitamin-C
lobby
to
keep
it
secret
.
It
was
in
their
interests
to
make
work
for
the
dental
profession
and
sell
vitamin
C
,
not
to
let
it
get
about
that
simply
by
keeping
their
hands
where
they
ought
to
be
young
people
could
have
healthy
teeth
and
gums
for
life
.
Later
on
Adam
wondered
if
his
father
had
made
all
this
up
or
if
he
really
believed
it
himself
.
It
was
not
a
theory
to
be
come
across
elsewhere
.
But
the
curious
thing
was
that
the
idea
had
somehow
and
much
against
his
will
taken
root
in
his
consciousness
.
He
did
not
believe
it
,
he
ridiculed
it
-
to
his
sister
,
for
instance
-
but
it
partially
attained
the
effect
Lewis
aimed
at
.
If
Adam
ever
got
as
far
as
masturbating
,
and
naturally
he
sometimes
did
,
he
always
had
the
feeling
afterwards
that
his
teeth
were
loose
.
His
jaw
would
ache
and
once
,
when
he
cleaned
his
teeth
that
night
,
he
found
blood
on
his
toothbrush
.
So
he
had
no
recourse
to
masturbation
that
afternoon
but
went
back
into
the
lake
instead
,
which
was
cold
enough
to
supply
one
of
the
well-known
Victorian
antidotes
to
sexual
desire
.
Wading
out
of
the
lake
,
his
legs
muddy
up
to
the
knees
,
Adam
sat
on
the
bank
among
the
bulrushes
and
the
great
,
pale
,
leathery
hosta
leaves
and
looked
at
the
house
with
its
canopy
of
roses
and
honeysuckle
,
the
martins
'
nest
under
the
eaves
,
the
long
terrace
with
Zeus
in
his
various
avatars
and
his
loves
disporting
themselves
along
the
flint
wall
.
Some
brightly
coloured
butterflies
,
orange
and
yellow
and
black
and
white
-
his
father
would
have
known
their
names
-
sunned
themselves
on
the
mellow
rosy
brickwork
,
spreading
their
wings
flat
in
the
heat
.
The
sky
above
the
glittering
slate
roofs
was
as
blue
as
the
curious
lilies
which
had
just
begun
to
come
out
under
the
dining-room
window
,
trumpet
flowers
set
like
the
seed-head
of
a
dandelion
but
as
blue
as
-
the
sky
.
There
would
be
things
just
as
beautiful
in
Greece
and
it
would
be
as
hot
or
hotter
.
But
it
would
not
be
his
.
He
would
not
be
proprietor
of
all
he
surveyed
there
.
It
was
a
revelation
to
him
how
important
this
was
,
how
much
it
meant
.
He
had
never
previously
thought
of
himself
as
acquisitive
or
even
as
particularly
materialistic
.
The
truth
was
though
,
that
until
now
he
had
never
possessed
anything
much
,
so
how
could
he
know
?
It
gave
him
a
good
feeling
,
it
was
satisfying
,
just
to
think
as
he
walked
up
the
stairs
,
those
floors
are
mine
,
this
carved
wood
,
these
moulded
ceilings
.
And
when
he
came
into
the
Pincushion
Room
and
rested
his
elbows
on
the
window-ledge
,
he
would
look
out
of
the
window
at
the
garden
bright
with
midsummer
sun
or
bathed
in
moonlight
and
think
,
all
this
is
mine
,
that
garden
,
that
fruit
cage
within
the
flint
walls
,
that
lake
,
the
Little
Wood
,
as
far
as
I
can
see
on
either
side
of
me
and
in
front
of
the
house
and
behind
,
all
that
is
mine
-
He
was
beginning
to
think
he
could
not
bear
to
sell
it
.
It
was
a
long
time
since
Adam
had
had
a
dream
about
Zosie
.
Rufus
,
yes
,
and
Shiva
sometimes
and
Shiva
with
Vivien
,
but
it
was
a
year
since
Zosie
had
come
into
his
sleep
and
materialized
before
him
.
Things
happened
as
they
must
have
happened
,
only
in
fact
it
was
Rufus
who
had
picked
her
up
and
brought
her
back
to
Wyvis
Hall
.
Stopping
on
the
way
to
exact
his
pound
of
flesh
,
of
course
.
No
,
that
was
unfair
.
He
would
have
done
the
same
-
in
those
days
.
In
his
dream
it
was
he
who
was
driving
home
to
Nunes
from
Colchester
,
not
Goblander
though
,
but
the
car
he
had
now
,
the
Granada
.
She
was
waiting
where
in
life
she
had
waited
,
outside
the
station
,
near
where
the
road
forked
,
going
in
one
direction
to
Bures
,
in
the
other
to
Sudbury
.
There
had
been
a
great
Victorian
pile
of
a
hospital
there
then
,
maybe
still
was
unless
they
had
demolished
it
,
its
chimney
concealed
inside
a
mock
campanile
.
Small
and
delicate
,
fine-boned
,
pale
brown
skin
,
beige
really
,
pale
brown
,
wispy
,
very
short
hair
,
fey-faced
,
with
a
small
,
tip-tilted
nose
and
golden
eyes
like
a
cat
.
Someone
had
said
she
was
like
an
Abyssinian
cat
and
so
she
was
.
Very
young
,
a
child
,
only
she
was
not
that
.
Jeans
and
a
T-shirt
but
you
never
noticed
what
Zosie
wore
.
What
was
it
they
called
that
term
in
rhetoric
?
Zeugma
or
syllepsis
?
She
stood
there
wearing
a
back-pack
and
a
face
of
woe
.
He
drew
up
ahead
of
her
.
She
came
running
up
to
the
van
and
climbed
in
beside
him
.
It
was
a
hot
night
but
she
was
shivering
.
He
asked
her
where
she
wanted
to
go
.
"
Anywhere
,
"
she
said
.
"
Anywhere
?
"
"
I
do
n't
know
where
I
am
,
so
how
can
I
say
where
I
want
to
go
?
"
"
You
came
here
on
the
train
,
did
n't
you
?
"
She
started
laughing
and
through
her
laughter
her
teeth
chattered
.
"
I
came
out
of
there
.
"
She
turned
round
and
pointed
back
at
the
Victorian
building
with
the
campanile
chimney
.
"
What
is
it
?
"
he
said
.
"
Do
n't
you
know
?
It
's
a
bin
.
A
funny
farm
.
It
's
what
my
gran
calls
a
lunatic
asylum
.
"
Adam
woke
up
.
He
lay
thinking
of
Zosie
.
Had
she
been
a
bit
mad
?
Perhaps
,
but
temporarily
and
for
a
well-attested
reason
.
And
of
course
there
was
no
question
of
her
having
escaped
from
a
mental
hospital
or
of
ever
having
been
in
one
.
He
shook
the
dream
off
him
.
Rufus
had
called
her
a
waif
and
Adam
had
immediately
ridiculed
this
word
,
said
it
was
a
romantic
novelist
's
word
,
so
they
had
looked
it
up
in
Hilbert
's
Shorter
Oxford
Dictionary
and
found
illuminating
things
.
"
Something
waving
or
flapping
"
.
"
Something
borne
or
driven
by
the
wind
"
.
"
A
person
who
is
without
home
or
friends
;
one
who
lives
uncared-for
;
an
outcast
;
an
unowned
or
neglected
child
"
.
"
That
's
the
one
I
meant
,
"
said
Rufus
.
And
then
Adam
had
read
aloud
the
first
definition
:
"
A
piece
of
property
which
is
found
ownerless
and
which
,
if
unclaimed
within
a
fixed
period
after
due
notice
given
,
falls
to
the
lord
of
the
manor
.
"
Well
,
eventually
,
it
was
true
that
Zosie
had
fallen
to
him
.
The
waif
who
was
ownerless
and
unclaimed
had
fallen
to
the
lord
of
the
manor
.
A
father
himself
now
,
he
thought
of
those
parents
of
hers
,
her
mother
and
stepfather
,
who
had
lost
her
and
apparently
had
never
searched
,
had
never
even
declared
their
loss
,
been
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
.
Adam
wondered
if
Abigail
sometimes
woke
up
and
looked
for
him
in
the
dark
,
in
the
empty
room
,
and
fretted
for
a
while
before
she
began
to
cry
.
He
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
it
.
It
was
deep
night
,
three
or
four
o'clock
.
Mark
Twain
had
written
somewhere
:
We
are
all
mad
at
night
.
He
got
out
of
bed
silently
,
in
the
dark
.
So
many
times
he
had
padded
across
this
bedroom
to
go
to
Abigail
that
he
knew
it
perfectly
in
the
dark
,
only
requiring
to
hold
his
hands
out
before
him
and
,
like
a
blind
man
,
feel
the
bevelled
comer
of
the
wardrobe
,
the
lacquered
wicker
of
a
chair
back
,
the
top
of
the
radiator
,
cold
at
this
hour
,
the
glass
sphere
of
the
door
knob
.
Outside
on
the
landing
he
put
a
light
on
.
Abigail
's
door
was
ajar
and
he
went
into
the
room
,
bringing
a
segment
of
light
with
him
,
a
triangle
that
fell
short
a
yard
from
her
cot
.
Instead
of
bending
over
her
,
he
knelt
down
and
looked
at
her
face
through
the
bars
.
She
opened
her
eyes
,
but
,
like
Lady
Macbeth
's
,
their
sense
was
shut
.
Awake
,
she
never
looked
at
him
without
smiling
.
She
did
not
smile
now
but
her
eyelids
with
those
amazing
lashes
slowly
closed
and
Abigail
gave
a
sigh
,
wriggled
her
body
,
moved
her
head
and
subsided
back
into
deep
sleep
.
Adam
knelt
beside
her
,
thinking
of
Zosie
and
Zosie
's
mother
and
stepfather
who
had
not
bothered
to
go
to
the
police
when
their
daughter
unaccountably
vanished
.
They
had
apparently
felt
as
if
a
burden
had
been
lifted
from
them
and
why
tempt
fate
by
attempting
to
get
her
back
?
But
Zosie
had
been
only
seventeen
.
Or
so
she
said
,
Adam
thought
.
But
perhaps
she
was
a
year
or
two
older
than
that
or
even
more
.
She
was
such
a
liar
.
You
might
be
able
to
tell
a
person
's
age
after
they
were
dead
but
often
not
while
they
were
still
alive
.
For
instance
,
the
newspaper
had
said
the
skeleton
in
the
cemetery
at
Wyvis
Hall
was
of
a
young
woman
between
18
and
21
years
old
.
Not
that
that
was
specially
relevant
-
He
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
,
looking
out
into
his
garden
.
A
narrow
plot
of
mean
suburban
proportions
compared
to
the
place
he
had
once
possessed
.
Street
lamps
were
on
in
the
distance
,
greenish
or
blobs
of
orange
light
.
There
was
no
moon
,
only
the
perpetual
chemical
twilight
that
subsists
in
suburbs
by
night
.
Autumn
had
laid
a
misty
chill
over
everything
that
grew
.
Plants
had
become
sticks
,
leaves
were
rags
of
wet
,
black
plastic
,
tree
branches
were
bones
with
arthritic
joints
.
We
are
all
mad
at
three
in
the
morning
.
There
had
never
been
another
summer
like
that
one
.
1984
had
been
good
but
not
as
good
as
that
.
The
night
had
been
warm
too
,
not
just
the
daytime
,
and
even
after
sunset
the
temperature
had
not
seemed
to
drop
much
.
They
had
driven
home
arguing
about
which
night
was
Midsummer
night
.
Mary
said
it
was
20
June
because
that
was
the
night
before
the
solstice
,
the
longest
day
,
and
Rufus
said
it
was
the
24th
and
he
,
Adam
,
said
it
was
the
23rd
because
that
was
the
eve
of
the
24th
which
was
Midsummer
day
.
They
were
all
rather
drunk
and
,
by
analogy
from
the
argument
,
Rufus
had
sung
at
the
the
top
of
his
voice
:
"
Where
the
bee
fucks
There
fuck
I
-
"
There
was
a
rugger-player
side
to
Rufus
.
Mary
,
often
so
censorious
,
was
sweetened
by
drink
.
Everything
Rufus
said
made
her
giggle
and
clutch
at
him
.
They
shared
a
cigarette
,
passing
it
from
mouth
to
mouth
.
Lying
on
the
back
seat
,
Adam
recited
"
Grantchester
"
,
which
in
those
days
he
knew
by
heart
:
"
And
green
and
deep
The
stream
mysterious
glides
beneath
,
Green
as
a
dream
and
deep
as
death
-
"
Back
at
home
they
lay
out
on
the
terrace
on
the
spread
quilts
and
Rufus
said
he
would
sleep
there
.
Gnats
came
in
swarms
from
the
lake
to
torment
them
,
so
they
lit
incense
sticks
to
keep
them
away
,
peppermint
and
aniseed
and
sandalwood
.
Mary
had
found
some
oil
of
citronella
in
an
old-fashioned
medicine
chest
in
the
Deathbed
Room
and
they
rubbed
it
on
themselves
for
good
measure
.
Or
rubbed
it
on
each
other
,
rather
.
That
was
what
started
it
.
All
was
silent
.
Sometimes
you
heard
a
soft
splash
as
a
fish
jumped
for
one
of
the
swarming
insects
.
Or
the
whispering
rattle
of
a
bat
's
wing
.
And
occasionally
,
from
the
depths
of
the
wood
,
came
less
agreeable
sounds
.
"
The
noise
made
by
something
being
murdered
by
something
else
,
"
Rufus
had
told
an
acquaintance
in
one
of
the
pubs
.
Rabbit
victims
of
foxes
or
weasels
,
Adam
supposed
it
was
.
The
thin
,
pitiful
cries
were
somehow
unearthly
when
they
waked
him
in
the
dark
small
hours
.
But
no
cries
came
to
them
there
on
the
terrace
,
the
darkness
lit
by
the
moon
,
the
bright
stars
spread
like
a
net
across
a
sky
that
never
lost
its
blueness
,
the
scented
tapers
burning
between
the
statuary
of
the
amorous
god
.
Rufus
had
a
bottle
of
red
wine
but
he
was
drinking
the
wine
out
of
one
of
Hilbert
's
brandy
glasses
.
"
We
're
not
going
to
Greece
,
are
we
?
"
Adam
said
.
"
I
should
n't
think
so
for
a
moment
,
"
said
Rufus
,
whose
speech
grew
more
precise
when
he
was
drunk
.
"
Why
should
we
do
that
?
"
"
If
you
remember
,
it
was
our
intention
.
"
"
I
want
to
go
to
Greece
,
"
said
Mary
,
but
smilingly
and
rather
sleepily
.
"
No
,
you
do
n't
,
my
sweetheart
.
You
want
to
stay
here
and
rub
some
of
that
disgusting
stuff
all
over
Adam
.
"
Rufus
was
setting
it
up
.
Adam
did
n't
immediately
realize
this
,
but
after
a
little
while
he
did
.
Rufus
was
always
a
sensation
seeker
,
wanting
new
experiences
,
new
indulgences
.
He
would
have
made
a
good
bad
Roman
Emperor
.
Adam
had
put
out
his
hand
for
the
citronella
but
Rufus
stopped
him
.
"
No
,
let
her
do
it
.
"
Adam
had
a
shirt
on
,
the
kind
that
buttons
up
,
not
a
T-shirt
,
but
now
he
began
to
take
it
off
,
having
an
idea
of
what
might
be
about
to
happen
.
The
mixture
of
gin
and
wine
he
had
drunk
hammered
in
his
head
,
distorting
reality
,
opening
limitless
possibilities
,
showing
him
a
fantasy
world
that
rocked
and
shimmered
.
But
all
he
could
say
was
,
"
We
'll
save
Greece
for
another
year
.
We
wo
n't
go
to
Greece
this
time
-
"
Mary
's
fingers
moved
lightly
across
his
back
.
Rufus
had
propped
himself
up
on
one
elbow
,
watching
.
He
leaned
across
Adam
to
light
a
cigarette
from
one
of
the
incense
sticks
and
he
smiled
,
letting
the
smoke
trickle
out
between
his
teeth
.
Mary
told
Adam
to
turn
round
and
face
her
,
she
would
do
his
chest
.
It
was
a
bit
like
having
someone
rub
you
with
suntan
cream
,
yet
it
was
n't
like
that
at
all
-
how
could
it
be
in
the
dark
?
What
it
was
like
was
being
anointed
by
some
slave
girl
.
Rufus
threw
his
cigarette
away
and
from
behind
her
laid
his
hand
lightly
on
Mary
's
bare
shoulder
.
She
was
wearing
a
halter
top
thing
that
tied
round
the
back
of
her
neck
.
All
the
time
,
right
up
till
then
and
a
little
beyond
,
Mary
had
n't
known
what
was
going
on
.
Rufus
,
of
course
,
had
always
known
,
Rufus
had
instigated
the
whole
thing
,
and
then
,
at
this
point
,
Adam
realized
it
.
The
realization
resulted
in
a
leap
of
desire
that
was
brought
about
as
much
by
Rufus
,
by
the
recollection
of
their
slippery
,
buoyant
contact
beneath
the
water
,
as
by
the
sight
of
Mary
as
Rufus
untied
the
knot
on
her
neck
and
slid
the
halter
top
down
with
his
hands
.
This
movement
,
as
Rufus
had
no
doubt
intended
,
sent
Mary
toppling
forward
into
Adam
's
arms
,
her
breasts
lightly
slapping
into
his
chest
in
a
way
that
would
have
been
blissful
if
it
had
been
allowed
to
continue
but
Mary
,
drunk
as
she
was
,
had
sprung
aside
,
actually
sprung
to
her
feet
,
and
rather
late
in
the
day
hugged
her
arms
across
her
chest
.
"
Now
what
's
the
bloody
matter
?
"
drawled
Rufus
.
"

'm

sighed
Adam
,
"

"
He
might
be
drunk
and
bursting
with
frustration
but
words
came
first
with
him
.
An
etymologist
he
was

bitter

The
confusion
arises
from

is

Latin
though
but

of
the
derivation
from
the
Greek

She
stalked
off
into
the
house
.
Rufus
went
on
laughing
,
hiccuping
with
laughter
.
He
lay
on
his
back
,
pouring
red
wine
down
his
throat
.

After
that
he
often
called
Mary
the
closet
tribade
.
She
was
right
when
she
said

"
How

said
Rufus
,
and
he
turned
,
his
mouth
all
dabbled
with
wine
,
to
look
into
Adam
's
eyes
.
And
Adam
had
looked
into
his
,
the
wine
singing
in
his
head
,
the
incense
tapers
smouldering
,
scenting
the
warm
dark
air
.
"
Why
not
?
"
But
Rufus
had
lain
there
,
not
touching
Adam
,
just
smiling
.
He
had
languidly
stretched
one
arm
out
and
in
doing
so
knocked
over
the
wine
bottle
.
It
had
fallen
too
slowly
to
break
but
the
wine
had
flowed
out
and
made
a
dark
stain
like
blood
on
the
white
candlewick
.
The
tips
of
his
outflung
fingers
just
touched
Adam
's
bare
shoulder
and
Adam
had
lain
still
,
aware
of
that
warm
,
faintly
tingling
pressure
,
but
happily
,
even
serenely
,
aware
,
trying
for
some
unknown
reason
to
count
the
stars
.
The
last
thing
he
remembered
Rufus
say
was
uttered
on
a
murmuring
chuckle
.
"
The
Greek
verb
"
to
rub
"
!
"
And
then
Rufus
was
asleep
,
his
head
turned
on
to
the
muscle
of
his
upper
arm
,
the
fingers
that
had
been
on
Adam
's
shoulder
retracting
as
they
relaxed
.
Adam
slept
too
,
very
soon
afterwards
,
and
awoke
shivering
with
cold
at
dawn
as
one
does
after
sleeping
uncovered
in
the
open
air
.
He
had
,
and
was
going
to
have
,
the
worst
hangover
of
his
life
,
but
even
in
the
throes
of
it
he
was
aware
of
a
sense
of
relief
that
they
were
staying
there
,
they
were
not
going
to
Greece
.
The
sky
was
a
clear
,
pale
dome
,
covered
in
the
east
by
a
flock
of
tiny
clouds
that
were
already
turned
to
pink
by
the
sun
that
was
still
concealed
,
that
had
not
yet
risen
.
The
garden
was
no
longer
silent
but
noisy
with
birdsong
,
with
twittering
,
cheeping
,
cooing
sounds
,
and
with
the
true
,
clear
notes
of
the
blackbird
and
thrush
.
Adam
got
to
his
feet
and
,
throwing
one
of
the
quilts
over
Rufus
,
went
into
the
house
.
Two
things
happened
the
next
day
.
Or
one
of
those
things
happened
.
He
was
n't
sure
of
remembering
the
date
of
the
other
thing
.
It
might
have
been
on
the
Saturday
.
The
coypu-control
man
must
have
come
on
a
weekday
,
though
,
and
it
was
with
that
hangover
that
Adam
associated
his
coming
.
Now
when
he
and
Anne
had
people
to
stay
they
ran
around
after
their
guests
making
sure
they
were
comfortable
.
One
or
both
of
them
got
up
early
to
make
break&amp;st
in
good
time
.
They
made
enquiries
as
to
whether
the
beds
were
all
right
and
the
water
hot
.
It
was
what
their
parents
had
done
when
they
had
guests
.
But
a
different
system
had
prevailed
at
Wyvis
Hall
,
or
rather
no
system
had
prevailed
at
all
.
Everyone
fended
for
themselves
.
That
was
the
way
Adam
wanted
it
and
had
in
fact
been
vociferous
on
the
subject
,
vowing
that
neither
now
nor
in
the
future
would
he
ever
give
in
to
those
bourgeois
values
and
customs
.
So
he
did
nothing
for
Mary
or
Rufus
that
morning
,
did
not
even
seek
them
out
,
scarcely
knew
whether
Rufus
was
still
asleep
on
the
terrace
or
back
in
bed
with
Mary
,
and
when
he
found
further
sleep
impossible
because
of
his
shivering
body
and
pounding
head
,
he
sat
in
the
kitchen
making
instant
coffee
for
himself
but
took
none
up
to
them
.
He
had
already
taken
two
aspirins
about
half
an
hour
before
and
now
he
took
four
more
.
The
table
he
sat
at
was
circular
and
made
of
pine
or
what
Hilbert
and
Adam
's
father
had
called
deal
.
Adam
was
thinking
about
this
interesting
word
that
used
to
be
simply
another
term
for
pine
but
which
originally
meant
a
certain
size
of
plank
,
from
the
Low
German
dele
,
when
there
came
a
loud
knocking
on
the
back
door
.
It
gave
him
a
shock
in
his
fragile
state
.
He
crept
to
the
door
and
opened
it
,
blinking
at
the
bright
light
.
Outside
stood
a
man
,
middle-aged
,
with
thinning
dark
hair
and
a
black
moustache
,
wearing
jeans
and
a
lightweight
jacket
in
pale
blue
plastic
.
He
said
his
name
was
Pearson
,
he
was
from
coypu
control
and
would
it
be
all
right
for
him
to
take
a
look
round
the
lake
?
"
What
control
?
"
said
Adam
.
"
New
here
,
are
you
?
I
used
to
see
a
Mr
Smith
.
"
Adam
said
he
was
dead
.
Was
"
coypu
"
an
acronym
?
The
man
looked
at
him
as
if
he
was
mad
.
"
It
's
a
sort
of
rat
,
is
n't
it
?
"
Adam
gave
up
.
"
Look
all
you
want
,
"
he
said
.
"
Right
,
and
I
'll
take
a
shufti
round
the
wood
while
I
'm
about
it
.
That
field
next
to
you
's
down
to
sugar
beet
this
year
.
Your
coypu
is
crazy
for
sugar
beet
.
"
They
are
n't
mine
,
Adam
wanted
to
say
but
desisted
.
In
Hilbert
's
dictionary
he
found
coypu
defined
as
a
South
American
aquatic
rodent
,
myopotamus
coypus
,
somewhat
smaller
than
a
beaver
.
He
liked
the
Latin
name
so
much
that
he
made
up
a
sort
of
rhyme
about
it
and
chanted
this
as
he
went
upstairs
:
"
Flittermus
,
ottermus
,
Myopotamus
...
"
From
the
window
of
the
Pincushion
Room
he
watched
the
man
pottering
about
the
edge
of
the
lake
.
In
one
hand
he
held
a
sack
,
in
the
other
what
might
have
been
metal
traps
,
or
not
that
at
all
but
some
kind
of
implement
.
How
could
coypu
have
got
into
a
Suffolk
pond
?
Must
be
an
escape
from
a
zoo
,
he
thought
,
just
as
mink
could
be
from
fur
farms
.
Going
down
again
in
search
of
more
coffee
,
he
met
Mary
coming
up
the
stairs
wearing
Rufus
's
jeans
and
a
dirty
T-shirt
with
Louisiana
State
University
printed
on
it
.
Mary
looked
the
nearest
to
ugly
he
had
ever
seen
her
.
She
gave
him
a
sullen
glare
and
said
in
a
very
distant
way
did
he
know
there
was
some
awful
peasant
trespassing
round
the
lake
?
"
He
is
n't
trespassing
.
"
Adam
started
singing
"
Flittermus
,
ottermus
"
to
the
tune
of
the
Austrian
Hymn
.
"
You
mean
hippopotamus
.
"
Adam
said
he
did
n't
,
he
meant
myopotamus
,
which
in
turn
meant
coypu
that
were
presumably
now
in
the
process
of
being
exterminated
,
whereupon
Mary
burst
into
shouts
of
anger
and
distress
,
calling
him
a
cruel
beast
and
an
enemy
of
ecology
.
"
There
ca
n't
be
anything
ecological
about
preserving
South
American
rodents
in
Suffolk
,
"
Adam
protested
,
but
by
then
Mary
was
tearing
off
downstairs
,
bent
on
tackling
the
coypu
controller
herself
.
Adam
took
a
look
out
of
the
window
of
the
bedroom
that
had
been
Hilbert
's
.
The
van
,
which
had
Vermstroy
Pest
Control
Ltd
,
Ipswich
and
Nunes
,
painted
on
its
side
,
was
turning
round
on
the
open
area
in
front
of
the
garage
.
As
Mary
came
running
out
of
the
front
door
it
moved
off
up
the
drift
towards
the
wood
.
It
made
him
laugh
to
see
her
standing
there
,
shaking
her
fist
at
the
departing
van
.
He
had
begun
to
feel
better
,
the
aspirins
and
coffee
were
doing
their
work
.
Rufus
was
still
lying
asleep
on
the
terrace
,
though
at
some
point
he
must
have
awakened
,
for
he
was
shaded
from
the
sun
by
Hilbert
's
old
black
umbrella
which
he
had
opened
and
propped
there
to
shelter
his
head
and
face
.
Adam
sat
down
beside
him
,
wondering
if
he
would
have
to
pay
the
coypu
man
.
"
I
could
sell
those
guns
,
"
he
said
,
when
Rufus
woke
up
.
"
Or
more
directly
,
dismiss
the
coypu
man
,
keep
the
guns
and
shoot
the
coypu
yourself
.
"
That
was
all
very
well
but
there
were
going
to
be
a
lot
of
things
to
pay
.
Rates
,
for
instance
.
Adam
found
himself
not
at
all
sure
what
rates
were
but
he
knew
that
people
who
owned
houses
did
pay
them
.
And
there
would
be
bills
for
electricity
and
water
.
The
guns
could
be
sold
and
more
of
the
furniture
.
Unless
-
Unless
he
could
rent
rooms
out
to
people
,
or
better
still
,
gather
a
group
of
people
here
who
all
paid
their
way
,
start
a
commune
in
fact
.
This
was
the
first
thought
he
had
ever
had
of
the
commune
,
it
was
at
that
moment
it
first
came
to
him
,
out
on
the
terrace
sitting
beside
Rufus
under
Hilbert
's
umbrella
,
while
the
Vermstroy
man
hunted
his
quarry
along
the
woodland
streams
and
Mary
pursued
him
with
cries
of
protest
.
Adam
,
among
his
computers
,
reflected
on
the
coypu
man
,
whose
bill
he
had
later
paid
,
but
whom
he
had
never
seen
again
.
Would
the
coypu
man
remember
?
And
if
he
did
would
he
be
able
to
declare
categorically
to
the
police
that
Adam
and
Rufus
and
Mary
had
actually
been
living
there
?
It
must
have
been
on
or
about
25
June
,
before
the
others
had
come
.
From
the
lake
the
coypu
man
would
have
seen
Rufus
sleeping
under
the
umbrella
on
the
terrace
and
no
doubt
also
seen
Mary
and
probably
spoken
to
her
-
have
practically
been
assaulted
by
her
.
He
was
about
fifty
or
rather
more
.
Very
likely
he
was
still
alive
.
Vermstroy
operated
from
Ipswich
but
it
also
operated
from
Nunes
.
The
coypu
man
lived
in
Nunes
.
Later
on
,
on
a
rare
trip
through
the
village
in
Goblander
Adam
had
seen
that
van
parked
in
the
front
garden
in
one
of
those
big
Hampstead
Garden
Suburb
houses
.
Of
course
it
was
possible
the
van
was
parked
there
only
because
the
man
was
inside
destroying
coypu
or
moles
or
rats
or
woodworm
,
but
somehow
Adam
did
n't
think
so
.
He
recalled
the
way
it
had
been
parked
,
its
nose
halfway
inside
the
open
The
man
had
been
in
the
wood
and
had
perhaps
seen
the
animal
cemetery
.
Adam
could
not
know
if
he
had
but
it
was
quite
possible
.
He
would
know
that
there
were
people
living
at
Wyvis
Hall
.
If
nothing
else
,
the
appearance
of
the
terrace
,
arranged
like
a
huge
bed
,
would
have
told
him
that
.
Evans
or
Owens
,
the
furniture
man
,
who
had
come
twice
to
the
house
,
had
been
at
least
sixty
then
.
He
was
hardly
a
danger
.
The
gardener
who
had
worn
a
knotted
handkerchief
on
his
head
,
whoever
he
might
have
been
,
had
had
no
means
of
knowing
then
or
later
that
Adam
intended
to
live
there
.
The
visitor
whose
footsteps
he
had
heard
circling
the
house
that
last
dawn
they
had
ever
spent
there
,
if
indeed
he
had
heard
them
and
not
,
in
his
state
of
panic
,
imagined
them
-
that
man
or
woman
would
have
had
no
evidence
for
thinking
anyone
lived
there
but
for
the
presence
of
Goblander
on
the
drive
.
But
the
coypu
man
was
different
.
The
coypu
man
could
not
be
dismissed
or
the
danger
of
him
glossed
over
.
Hope
lay
only
in
the
possibility
,
the
fairly
strong
possibility
,
that
he
was
one
of
those
who
do
not
push
themselves
forward
into
police
investigations
unless
directly
called
upon
.
The
next
day
or
the
day
after
perhaps
,
when
they
had
talked
a
lot
about
the
commune
project
,
Mary
had
come
up
with
Bella
's
name
.
It
had
been
more
roundabout
than
that
but
that
was
basically
it
.
She
and
Rufus
and
Adam
himself
had
all
been
putting
forward
the
names
of
people
they
knew
who
might
want
to
be
part
of
a
commune
,
likely
people
of
the
right
sort
of
age
and
the
right
sort
of
temperament
.
Mary
herself
was
quite
keen
,
stipulating
though
that
she
would
only
stay
if
Rufus
did
not
.
Since
his
sly
suggestions
of
Thursday
midnight
she
had
been
unremittingly
at
war
with
him
,
though
they
still
ostensibly
shared
a
bed
.
In
fact
Rufus
had
taken
mostly
to
sleeping
out-doors
.
He
had
no
intention
,
he
said
,
of
being
part
of
a
permanent
commune
,
he
had
his
medical
degree
to
get
,
but
he
might
think
of
coming
there
for
his
holidays
.
He
upset
Mary
further
by
saying
he
thought
Adam
's
sister
Bridget
very
attractive
and
it
would
be
an
inducement
to
him
if
she
became
one
of
the
members
.
Adam
did
n't
want
his
sister
,
they
did
n't
get
on
all
that
well
.
He
could
think
of
two
of
his
fellow
students
who
might
be
suitable
but
they
too
had
degree
courses
to
finish
and
Adam
was
beginning
to
think
very
seriously
of
not
returning
to
college
.
The
peculiar
mixed
course
he
was
doing
he
had
always
had
doubts
about
.
The
linguistics
part
he
knew
already
,
the
English
he
could
pick
up
on
his
own
and
the
sociology
bored
him
.
What
was
the
good
of
a
BA
from
that
tinpot
redbrick
place
anyway
?
He
might
as
well
be
at
a
polytechnic
.
If
he
wanted
a
degree
he
could
just
as
well
get
one
at
the
technical
college
in
Ipswich
-
Rufus
put
up
two
or
three
names
,
one
being
of
someone
they
had
both
been
at
school
with
.
You
wanted
at
least
one
person
who
had
been
in
a
commune
before
,
Mary
said
,
and
perhaps
you
ought
to
advertise
along
those
lines
.
In
Time
Out
,
say
.
"
Or
Gay
News
,
"
said
Rufus
.
"
"
Tribade
seeks
fellow
travellers
"
help
out
of
the
closet
.
"
'
"
I
do
just
wonder
,
"
Mary
said
,
"
why
you
go
on
and
on
and
on
about
it
.
Could
it
just
be
you
've
got
a
closet
of
your
own
,
d'
you
think
?
"
Rufus
started
laughing
at
that
and
said
all
the
doors
in
his
life
were
strictly
never
kept
closed
.
"
Open
house
and
bring
your
friends
.
"
"
It
's
a
mystery
to
me
you
've
got
any
.
"
Adam
had
n't
liked
the
idea
of
advertising
.
Besides
,
money
was
short
.
Before
they
got
on
to
the
subject
of
the
commune
they
had
been
discussing
which
item
of
Hilbert
's
former
property
they
should
sell
next
.
One
of
the
big
cabinets
,
Rufus
said
,
and
no
nonsense
about
it
,
get
Evans
or
Owens
back
,
but
Adam
could
see
his
house
being
stripped
bare
.
If
people
came
and
put
money
into
the
commune
-
"
There
's
a
girl
I
know
of
called
Bella
something
,
"
said
Mary
.
"
I
do
n't
know
her
.
It
's
my
friend
Linda
that
knows
her
.
She
used
to
be
one
of
that
Rajneesh
lot
,
she
always
lives
in
communes
,
and
Linda
told
me
she
was
looking
for
somewhere
.
I
mean
I
could
find
out
more
about
this
Bella
.
"
It
was
through
Bella
,
of
course
,
that
Vivien
found
them
and
with
her
the
Indian
,
Shiva
,
whose
other
name
Adam
could
not
remember
.
Mary
was
the
only
one
of
them
,
as
far
as
he
knew
,
who
had
ever
walked
to
the
village
and
walked
about
in
the
village
when
she
got
there
.
It
would
not
matter
what
any
inhabitant
of
Nunes
told
the
police
about
Mary
,
for
she
had
departed
soon
after
that
.
And
if
people
remembered
her
they
would
not
have
known
where
she
came
from
.
She
had
gone
to
the
village
-
as
Vivien
had
later
gone
-
to
use
the
public
phone-box
outside
the
Fir
Tree
.
Probably
she
went
into
the
Fir
Tree
or
the
village
shop
to
get
change
for
those
calls
.
She
had
been
phoning
people
who
might
go
to
Greece
with
her
or
drive
her
there
or
,
failing
that
,
pay
her
air-fare
,
and
eventually
she
succeeded
in
getting
a
loan
from
an
aunt
and
an
offer
of
a
place
in
a
minibus
from
an
old
schoolfellow
and
her
boyfriend
.
The
day
before
she
left
he
thought
of
a
new
name
for
his
house
.
For
some
days
he
had
been
mulling
this
over
,
trying
to
come
up
with
something
more
interesting
than
Wyvis
Hall
.
Myopotamus
Manor
,
which
had
occurred
to
him
,
was
just
a
joke
.
He
began
anagramming
,
twisting
letters
round
,
keeping
in
mind
where
they
had
been
going
,
where
Mary
was
still
going
-
Ecalpemos
.
He
asked
the
others
what
they
thought
Ecalpemos
was
.
"
A
Greek
island
,
"
said
Mary
.
"
Not
an
island
,
"
said
Rufus
.
"
More
like
a
mountain
.
A
volcano
.
"
"
Or
a
resort
on
the
Costa
Brava
.
"
"
You
just
made
it
up
,
"
said
Rufus
lazily
.
"
It
does
sound
rather
like
a
community
.
Oneida
,
Walden
,
Ecalpemos
.
"
"
It
does
n't
sound
in
the
least
like
Oneida
or
Walden
.
I
know
what
it
is
,
it
's
like
Erewhon
:
that
's
"
nowhere
"
backwards
.
"
Adam
was
surprised
at
Mary
's
perspicacity
but
annoyed
that
she
was
leaving
.
He
did
n't
like
her
much
but
wanted
her
to
stay
.
He
was
finding
he
resented
people
who
did
not
care
for
Wyvis
Hall
as
much
as
he
did
.
"

anagram

he
said
.
"
Bloody

Why
talk
about

if

"
"

said
Rufus
.
"

"

.
"
Which
thereafter
it
always
was
.
The
next
day
was
30
June
,
a
Wednesday
.
Mary
wanted
Rufus
to
drive
her
all
the
way
back
to
London
but
he
said
Colchester
was
his
limit
and
she
could
get
a
train
from
there
.
There
was
a
certain
rapprochement
though
,
as
Mary
came
down
with
her
things
in
the
back-pack
Rufus
had
lent
her
and
wearing
jeans
and
a
pair
of
sandals
for
the
first
time
for
days
.
"
I
actually
adored
it
,
"
she
said
to
Adam
,
"
only
I
'd
promised
myself
I
'd

to
Greece
these
holidays

I
absolutely

n't
not
go
now

"
"
That
's
OK

Ecalpemos

still
be
here
next
year

"
"
I
did
wonder
if
you
'd
like
me
to
send
cards
to
your
parents
and
Rufus
's
from
Athens
.
I
mean
ones
you
'd
write
here
and
I
'd
take
them
with
me
.
"
"
By
a
quite
exceptional
oversight
,
"
said
Rufus
,
"
I
do
n't
just
happen
to
have
any
picture
postcards
of
the
Acropolis
about
me
at
present
.
"
"
It
was
just
a
thought

"
Mary
said
sulkily
.
"
It
did
n't
have
to
be
cards

it
could
have
been
a
letter

"
If
mine

a
letter

said
Rufus
,
"
they
'd
think
I
was
dying
or
in
jail
.
"
It
amounted
to
the
same
thing
for
him
.
And
why
bother
to
write
anyway
?
What
was
there
to
say
?
Mary
had
some
vague
idea
that
Adam
's
parents
might
suspect
he
was
down
here
and
come
to
see
him
.
But
Adam
could
n't
see
why
they
should
.
If
only
he
had
acceded
to
that
suggestion
of
hers
!
The
ironical
thing
was
that
all
the
time
,
in
a
stack
in
Hilbert
's
desk
,
secured
by
a
rubber
band
,
were
fifty
or
so
old
postcards
collected
by
Hilbert
and
Lilian
presumably
on
early
travels
and
among
them
were
two
of
Greece
,
one
of
Mount
Lycabettos
and
the
other
the
very
view
Rufus
had
spoken
of
so
scathingly
.
But
they
had
n't
known
that
then
,
and
if
they
had
could
not
have
known
how
much
one
day
such
postcards
would
have
supported
the
story
Adam
was
beginning
to
think
he
would
tell
.
Always
supposing
their
parents
had
kept
the
postcards
,
which
,
considering
their
rarity
value
,
they
might
well
have
done
.
Mary
's
offer
had
been
rejected
without
their
thinking
twice
about
it
and
she
and
Adam
had
said
goodbye
in
a
cool
,
offhand
sort
of
way
and
Rufus
had
driven
her
off
to
the
station
in
Goblander
.
From
that
day
to
this
Adam
had
never
set
eyes
on
Mary
Gage
and
had
hardly
ever
thought
of
her
.
If
she
had
come
into
his
mind
he
had
operated
his
cancelling
switch
as
he
did
when
any
of
the
denizens
of
Ecalpemos
strayed
into
his
thoughts
.
Once
,
not
long
ago
,
an
old
film
called
National
Velvet
had
been
on
television
and
when
the
young
Elizabeth
Taylor
appeared
on
the
screen
he
had
at
once
been
sharply
reminded
of
Mary
-
and
had
exited
,
not
with
the
escape
key
but
with
the
switch
on
the
set
.
He
and
Rufus
had
talked
about
money
later
that
day
.
What
could
they
sell
next
?
Even
to
Adam
's
ignorant
eye
the
Victorian
watercolours
of
moorland
or
mountain
streams
,
mounted
on
gold
paper
and
framed
in
gilt
,
were
valueless
.
There
was
a
strange
picture
in
one
of
the
bedrooms
of
a
centaur-like
creature
,
a
horse
with
the
torso
and
head
of
a
man
,
presenting
itself
at
a
forge
to
be
shod
,
where
it
was
eyed
with
fearful
fascination
by
the
smith
and
a
crowd
of
onlookers
.
When
they
cut
away
the
paper
at
the
back
of
the
frame
it
proved
to
be
a
Böcklin
,
but
a
print
cut
from
a
magazine
,
the
original
being
in
Budapest
.
They
called
the
room
where
it
hung
the
Centaur
Room
.
Another
strange
picture
hung
in
Hilbert
's
room
,
one
that
Adam
had
never
allowed
himself
to
think
about
.
Since
the
birth
of
Abigail
it
would
have
been
torture
.
And
,
besides
,
the
picture
no
longer
existed
,
having
been
burnt
by
Adam
himself
,
destroyed
on
that
pyre
with
certain
other
things
.
A
large
gloomy
bedroom
had
been
the
setting
of
it
,
hung
with
draperies
,
not
the
kind
of
thing
you
would
expect
a
child
to
sleep
in
,
but
it
was
a
little
child
that
lay
on
the
bed
,
white
and
still
,
the
elderly
man
,
evidently
a
doctor
,
who
had
seemingly
just
lifted
a
looking
glass
from
the
parted
lips
,
turning
to
the
young
father
and
imparting
the
news
of
death
,
while
the
mother
in
a
transport
of
grief
clung
to
her
husband
,
her
head
buried
in
his
shoulder
.
Adam
confronted
this
remembered
picture
now
with
a
kind
of
stoicism
.
He
forced
himself
to
see
it
and
recall
those
things
which
were
connected
with
it
.
How
extraordinary
it
seemed
that
he
and
Rufus
had
stood
in
front
of
that
picture
and
laughed
at
it
!
To
remember
this
now
brought
him
an
actual
physical
pain
in
the
deeps
of
his
body
,
in
his
intestines
.
He
and
Rufus
had
stood
there
drinking
wine
.
Rufus
had
the
last
bottle
of
wine
in
his
left
hand
and
a
glassful
in
his
right
.
They
were
walking
round
the
house
speculating
as
to
what
they
should
sell
and
had
paused
here
in
this
far
from
gloomy
room
,
this
warm
,
sunny
,
charming
room
,
and
laughed
at
that
gloomy
picture
,
at
its
sentimental
naivety
.
In
fact
he
had
even
made
some
appropriately
sophisticated
comment
.
"
Dead
and
never
called
me
Mother
,
"
it
had
probably
been
.
That
was
the
reason
they
named
it
the
Deathbed
Room
.
On
into
the
Room
Without
a
Name
they
had
passed
and
through
to
the
room
it
communicated
with
,
the
Room
of
Astonishment
,
so
called
because
it
had
a
cupboard
in
it
with
a
little
staircase
inside
that
wound
its
way
up
into
the
loft
.
They
considered
the
saleability
of
a
washstand
,
a
swinging
mirror
,
a
flowered
pottery
basin
and
jug
,
and
then
as
they
descended
by
the
back
stairs
,
the
plates
in
dull
red
and
dark
blue
and
gold
glaze
that
hung
on
the
wall
there
and
might
,
from
the
hieroglyphs
on
their
backs
,
possibly
be
Chinese
and
perhaps
valuable
.
Next
day
they
had
taken
the
mirror
and
the
pottery
and
the
porcelain
to
Long
Melford
because
there
were
more
antique
shops
in
Long
Melford
than
anywhere
else
they
had
seen
,
but
£20
was
all
they
got
for
the
lot
.
When
people
came
to
join
the
commune
,
Adam
thought
,
they
would
have
to
pay
,
they
would
have
to
contribute
.
And
how
were
any
suitable
people
going
to
know
about
it
when
he
had
no
phone
,
or
no
phone
that
worked
,
and
Mary
Gage
had
probably
forgotten
all
about
this
Bella
?
There
,
of
course
,
he
had
been
wrong
.
All
the
time
he
and
Rufus
were
living
it
up
,
driving
about
the
countryside
in
Goblander
,
driving
to
London
once
to
buy
marijuana
from
the
dealer
Rufus
knew
in
Notting
Hill
,
drinking
and
smoking
(
as
he
had
put
it
)
Hilbert
's
furniture
away
,
all
that
time
Vivien
and
her
boyfriend
Shiva
were
making
arrangements
to
join
Ecalpemos
.
And
they
were
expecting
,
of
course
,
a
well-run
settlement
,
a
sort
of
East
Anglian
kibbutz
,
where
the
members
had
appointed
duties
,
where
vegetarianism
prevailed
and
brown
rice
had
an
almost
holy
significance
and
discussions
on
mystical
or
occult
or
philosophic
subjects
went
on
long
into
the
night
.
But
first
Zosie
had
come
.
Rufus
,
driving
back
from
London
with
the
hashish
his
dealer
swore
was
genuine
Indian
charas
and
a
package
of
best
Colombian
,
picked
her
off
the
street
-
"
a
piece
of
property
that
is
found
ownerless
"
.
And
she
had
slept
with
Rufus
in
the
Centaur
Room
,
it
being
taken
for
granted
she
would
share
his
bed
,
though
Adam
did
not
think
her
wishes
had
been
consulted
.
Rufus
was
a
bit
of
a
centaur
himself
,
a
big
roan
stallion
,
and
she
was
a
little
cat-eyed
-
waif
.
It
must
have
been
a
day
or
two
afterwards
that
she
had
seen
the
picture
.
Exploring
the
house
on
the
following
day
or
the
day
after
that
,
she
had
ventured
into
the
Deathbed
Room
.
She
had
gone
in
and
looked
at
that
picture
and
come
running
down
the
stairs
crying
,
with
her
hands
up
to
her
face
and
the
tears
pouring
.
"
Why
did
you
let
me
go
in
there
?
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
what
was
in
there
?
"
Just
for
a
moment
,
standing
by
the
window
,
dropping
the
edge
of
the
curtain
he
had
lifted
and
turning
back
towards
the
cot
,
Adam
saw
the
picture
again
,
saw
it
with
an
awful
clarity
on
the
darkness
before
his
eyes
.
The
painting
was
destroyed
.
He
had
burned
it
himself
on
the
fire
he
had
made
against
the
fruit-garden
wall
and
it
might
be
that
no
copies
of
it
existed
,
yet
in
his
mind
's
eye
it
recreated
itself
,
the
child
for
ever
stilled
,
its
face
a
waxen
mask
,
the
old
doctor
haggard
with
sorrow
and
lack
of
sleep
,
the
mirror
no
breath
had
misted
held
in
his
hand
,
the
parents
in
each
other
's
arms
.
