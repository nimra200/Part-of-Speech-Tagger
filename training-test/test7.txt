We
docked
at
midday
.
The
deserted
boatyard
was
swimming
in
heat
.
It
was
well
into
the
charter
business
's
low
season
,
so
the
vast
majority
of
Cutwater
's
yachts
had
either
gone
north
for
the
summer
or
were
sitting
on
jackstands
out
of
the
water
.
A
couple
of
our
bareboat
yachts
were
still
at
sea
,
and
Wavebreaker
had
one
more
paying
charter
to
complete
,
but
otherwise
McIllvanney
's
yard
had
the
torpor
of
tropical
summer
about
it
.
Even
Stella
,
McIllvanney
's
long-suffering
secretary
,
had
taken
the
day
off
,
leaving
the
office
locked
,
which
meant
I
had
to
walk
into
town
to
find
a
public
telephone
from
which
I
called
the
Bahamian
Police
and
told
them
about
Hirondelle
,
and
added
that
I
had
rescued
a
chart
and
a
handful
of
cartridges
from
the
stricken
boat
.
The
police
sounded
surprised
that
I
had
bothered
to
call
them
,
and
I
walked
back
to
the
boatyard
feeling
strangely
foolish
.
Ellen
laughed
at
my
punctiliousness
.
Doubtless
the
police
had
responded
to
my
call
by
sharpening
their
cutlasses
and
charging
their
muskets
,
she
mocked
,
in
readiness
for
an
invasion
of
Murder
Cay
?
"
I
did
n't
mention
Murder
Cay
,
"
I
said
.
"
I
just
told
them
about
the
bullet
damage
to
the
boat
and
about
the
chart
.
"
"
Well
now
that
you
've
single-handedly
won
the
war
on
drugs
,
perhaps
you
can
do
something
useful
,
like
scrub
the
deck
?
"
We
had
only
this
one
day
to
resupply
and
prepare
Wavebreaker
for
her
last
charter
,
which
meant
the
schooner
had
to
be
refuelled
and
provisioned
,
her
carpets
must
be
vacuumed
,
her
bilges
poisoned
against
rats
and
cockroaches
,
her
galley
made
spotless
,
her
deck
scrubbed
and
her
brightwork
polished
.
In
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
,
when
it
seemed
that
the
work
would
never
be
done
on
time
,
Bellybutton
arrived
at
the
yard
.
Bellybutton
was
McIllvanney
's
foreman
,
and
for
a
few
seconds
I
dared
hope
that
he
had
come
to
help
us
,
but
instead
he
told
me
that
one
of
the
bareboat
thirty-three-footers
was
in
trouble
.
"
The
man
radioed
that
his
engine
broke
,
"
Bellybutton
grumbled
,
"
so
I
have
to
fetch
the
idiot
in
Starkisser
.
"
He
was
pretending
that
the
errand
was
a
nuisance
,
though
at
the
same
time
he
was
grinning
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
taking
McIllvanney
's
brand
new
sportsboat
to
sea
.
Starkisser
's
midnight-blue
hull
had
metalflake
embedded
in
its
fibreglass
so
that
the
sleek
boat
seemed
to
scintillate
with
an
internal
and
infernal
dark
blue
light
.
She
had
to
be
one
of
the
fastest
production
boats
in
the
islands
;
her
twin
big-block
engines
could
hurl
the
three-ton
wedge-shaped
hull
at
over
eighty
miles
an
hour
,
and
it
worried
neither
McIllvanney
nor
Bellybutton
that
at
such
a
speed
a
man
could
not
hear
himself
scream
and
that
even
the
smallest
wave
shook
the
bones
right
out
of
their
flesh
.
"
There
ai
n't
a
girl
in
creation
who
do
n't
melt
after
a
ride
in
Starkisser
,
"
Bellybutton
liked
to
boast
.
His
real
name
was
Benjamin
,
but
no
one
ever
called
him
Benjamin
or
even
Ben
.
To
the
whole
island
he
was
Bellybutton
.
It
was
rumoured
he
had
earned
the
nickname
by
biting
the
navel
clean
out
of
a
whore
who
had
displeased
him
,
and
I
found
the
rumour
all
too
believable
for
he
was
not
a
pleasant
man
.
In
fact
he
was
a
black
version
of
McIllvanney
himself
;
rangy
,
knowing
,
tall
and
sarcastic
.
"
Mr
Mac
wants
to
see
you
tonight
,
"
Bellybutton
leered
at
me
,
as
though
he
suspected
I
would
not
enjoy
the
meeting
.
"
He
says
you
're
to
go
to
his
place
at
sundown
.
"
"
Why
is
n't
he
in
the
yard
today
?
"
I
asked
.
"
Mr
Mac
's
taking
a
day
off
!
"
Bellybutton
said
in
an
indignant
voice
,
as
though
my
question
had
impugned
McIllvanney
's
honour
.
"
He
has
business
to
take
care
of
.
He
had
to
take
a
boat
to
Miami
,
and
that
's
why
he
give
me
the
keys
to
Starkisser
.
You
maybe
want
to
take
Miss
Ellen
for
a
ride
in
Starkisser
?
"
He
dangled
the
sportsboat
's
keys
enticingly
.
"
I
wo
n't
tell
Mr
Mac
,
long
as
you
give
me
a
ride
on
Miss
Ellen
when
you
're
done
.
"
He
laughed
and
obscenely
pumped
his
lean
hips
.
"
You
're
an
offensive
shit
,
Bellybutton
,
"
I
said
in
a
very
friendly
voice
,
but
he
had
already
turned
his
attention
away
from
me
because
a
car
had
suddenly
appeared
in
the
yard
.
It
was
a
long
white
Lincoln
with
black-tinted
windows
.
The
car
slid
quietly
between
the
cradled
yachts
to
stop
just
short
of
Wavebreaker
's
pier
.
Apart
from
the
crunching
sound
of
the
tyres
the
Lincoln
's
approach
had
been
silent
and
oddly
sinister
.
One
of
the
passenger
doors
opened
and
a
very
tall
and
very
black-skinned
man
climbed
slowly
into
the
sunlight
.
"
A
friend
of
yours
?
"
I
asked
Bellybutton
,
but
his
eyes
widened
,
he
muttered
a
curse
and
,
instead
of
answering
,
he
dashed
frantically
towards
Starkisser
's
pontoon
.
The
tall
black
man
who
had
emerged
from
the
Lincoln
was
dressed
in
a
dark
blue
three-piece
suit
that
looked
incongruously
heavy
for
such
a
hot
day
.
He
wore
the
elegantly
cut
suit
over
a
white
shirt
and
an
old
Etonian
tie
.
He
was
impressively
built
;
thin
hipped
and
wide
shouldered
,
like
a
boxer
who
could
punch
hard
and
dance
lightly
.
He
looked
calmly
around
the
yard
,
then
put
on
a
pair
of
mirrored
sunglasses
before
slamming
the
car
door
shut
.
Bellybutton
had
thrown
off
Starkisser
's
lines
and
now
let
the
sportsboat
float
away
from
the
pontoon
as
he
unclipped
her
jet-black
cockpit
cover
.
Then
,
plainly
frantic
to
escape
the
elegant
man
,
he
punched
the
boat
's
engines
into
life
.
The
echo
of
the
twin
motors
crackled
back
from
the
nearby
buildings
like
the
sound
of
a
battle-tank
firing
up
for
action
.
Scared
pelicans
flapped
away
,
and
Ellen
came
up
from
the
galley
to
see
what
had
caused
the
commotion
.
Bellybutton
gave
one
last
look
at
the
man
walking
along
the
dock
,
then
shoved
Starkisser
's
tachometers
way
into
their
red
zones
so
that
the
dark
blue
powerboat
stood
on
her
tail
and
screamed
out
to
sea
as
though
the
devil
himself
was
on
her
tail
.
"
A
guilty
conscience
is
a
terrible
thing
.
"
The
tall
black
man
chuckled
,
then
sauntered
across
Wavebreaker
's
gangplank
.
Once
on
deck
he
stopped
to
admire
Ellen
who
was
dressed
in
a
brief
pair
of
shorts
and
a
faded
tank
top
.
Even
with
her
glorious
hair
scraped
back
into
a
loose
bun
,
and
with
her
hands
and
face
smeared
with
soap
and
sweat
from
the
exertions
of
scrubbing
the
galley
stove
,
she
looked
utterly
beguiling
.
The
black
man
momentarily
took
off
his
sunglasses
as
though
to
examine
Ellen
more
closely
and
I
saw
he
had
very
hard
and
very
cynical
eyes
that
were
suddenly
turned
full
on
me
.
"
You
must
be
Breakspear
.
"
"
Yes
.
"
"
My
name
is
Deacon
Billingsley
-
"
he
paused
as
though
I
should
recognise
the
name
,
"
and
I
am
a
police
officer
.
"
The
arrival
of
Deacon
Billingsley
should
have
given
me
the
satisfaction
that
my
telephone
call
had
been
treated
seriously
,
but
I
sensed
this
policeman
was
not
going
to
offer
me
any
satisfaction
at
all
.
He
had
spoken
very
flatly
,
making
his
introduction
sound
like
a
threat
.
The
sun
,
mirrored
in
the
obsidian
brightness
of
his
glasses
,
momentarily
dazzled
me
.
"
What
were
you
doing
when
you
found
Hirondelle

Breakspear
?

Billingsley
asked
me
.

"
"

He
mocked
my
British
accent
,
then
turned
on
Ellen
who
had
stayed
on
deck
to
hear
the
conversation
.
"
Where
were
you
coming
from
,
lady
?
"
"
Hey
!
Count
me
out
,
OK

I
did
n't
call
any
goddamn
cavalry
.
You
want
to
know
anything
about
that
boat
,
you
ask
Nick
,
not
me
.
"
She
twisted
contemptuously
towards
the
companionway
.
Billingsley
watched
her
walk
away
.
"
She
's
American
?
"
He
seemed
amused
rather
than
offended
by
Ellen
's
defiance
.
"
She
's
American
,
"
I
confirmed
.
Ellen
dropped
out
of
sight
and
Billingsley
turned
back
to
me
.
"
Are
you
screwing
the
American
,
Breakspear
?
"
I
was
so
astonished
by
the
sudden
question
that
I
just
gaped
at
him
.
"
Are
you
laying
the
girl
?
"
Billingsley
rephrased
his
insolent
question
as
though
I
had
not
understood
the
first
version
.
His
tone
of
voice
was
so
bland
that
he
might
as
well
have
been
asking
my
opinion
of
Wavebreaker
's
sea-keeping
qualities
.
"
The
answer
is
no
,
"
I
finally
said
,
"
and
fuck
off
.
"
Billingsley
lit
a
cigar
.
It
had
a
red
and
yellow
band
on
which
I
could
just
read
the
word
Cubana
.
He
took
his
time
;
first
cutting
the
cigar
,
then
heating
its
tip
with
a
succession
of
matches
that
he
carelessly
and
provocatively
dropped
on
to
Wavebreaker
's
scrubbed
deck
.
He
used
the
toes
of
his
expensive
brogues
to
grind
each
dead
match
into
the
teak-wood
so
that
the
charred
tips
smeared
black
carbonised
streaks
across
the
wood
's
bone-whiteness
.
He
finally
drew
the
cigar
into
red
heat
and
discarded
the
final
match
.
He
raised
his
eyes
to
stare
into
my
face
,
and
I
felt
a
surge
of
fear
.
It
was
not
Billingsley
's
physical
size
that
provoked
that
fear
,
for
I
was
of
a
size
with
him
,
nor
was
it
his
profession
that
gave
me
pause
,
but
rather
the
aura
of
incipient
violence
that
he
radiated
like
a
blast
furnace
.
"
You
mess
with
me
,
Breakspear
,
"
he
said
in
a
deceptively
mild
voice
,
"
and
I
'll
rip
your
spine
out
of
your
asshole
.
"
I
was
damned
if
I
would
show
him
my
fear
.
"
Do
you
have
a
warrant
card
?
"
I
asked
him
instead
.
For
a
second
I
thought
he
was
going
to
hit
me
,
but
then
he
reached
into
his
jacket
pocket
and
brought
out
a
wallet
that
he
unfolded
and
thrust
towards
me
,
giving
me
just
enough
time
to
see
that
he
held
the
rank
of
chief
inspector
,
one
of
the
highest
ranks
in
the
Bahamian
police
force
,
then
the
wallet
was
snapped
shut
and
Deacon
Billingsley
moved
to
stand
very
close
to
me
,
so
close
that
I
could
smell
the
cigar
smoke
on
his
breath
.
"
Where
's
the
chart
you
took
from
Hirondelle
?
"
"
Down
below
.
"
"
Then
fetch
it
,
"
he
said
dismissively
.
I
obeyed
.
The
chart
had
dried
into
stiff
and
faded
folds
,
but
Billingsley
did
not
look
at
it
,
instead
he
just
screwed
it
up
and
thrust
it
into
a
pocket
of
his
expensive
jacket
.
"
I
also
found
these
,
"
I
said
,
and
offered
him
the
handful
of
cartridge
cases
.
He
ignored
my
outstretched
hand
.
"
What
were
you
doing
at
Sister
Island
,
Breakspear
?
"
The
question
puzzled
me
for
I
had
not
mentioned
Sister
Island
,
nor
its
old
name
of
Murder
Cay
,
to
either
the
police
or
to
the
Defence
Forces
,
nor
had
Billingsley
troubled
to
look
at
the
pencilled
line
on
the
chart
,
yet
he
had
somehow
connected
Hirondelle
with
the
mysterious
island
.
"
I
asked
you
what
you
were
doing
at
Sister
Island
,
"
Deacon
Billingsley
said
threateningly
.
"
We
were
n't
anywhere
near
the
island
!
"
I
protested
.
"
You
can
check
that
for
yourself
!
I
reported
the
co-ordinates
where
we
found
Hirondelle
over
the
radio
,
and
those
co-ordinates
are
twenty
miles
north-west
of
Sister
Island
.
That
's
as
close
as
we
ever
got
to
it
.
"
He
said
nothing
for
a
few
seconds
,
and
I
sensed
that
I
might
have
unsettled
this
policeman
.
I
had
also
angered
him
,
though
his
anger
seemed
directed
at
himself
.
He
had
come
here
on
a
misunderstanding
;
believing
that
Wavebreaker
had
been
at
Murder
Cay
when
in
fact
we
had
not
even
been
within
sight
of
that
mysterious
island
.
But
Billingsley
had
clearly
known
about
Hirondelle
's
visit
to
Murder
Cay
,
and
I
realised
that
this
senior
police
officer
had
not
come
here
to
enquire
into
a
crime
,
but
to
cover
it
up
.
Hirondelle
's
owners
,
he
said
glibly
,
had
decided
to
fly
home
and
,
despairing
of
ever
selling
the
yacht
in
a
glutted
market
,
had
simply
abandoned
it
and
someone
had
evidently
used
the
hulk
for
target
practice
.
"
Maybe
it
was
the
Americans
,
"
Billingsley
suggested
airily
,
"
you
know
there
's
a
naval
exercise
in
progress
?
Perhaps
they
machine-gunned
the
hulk
?
"
"
Those
cartridge
cases
are
n't
American
issue
,
"
I
said
,
holding
out
the
green-lacquered
steel
casings
.
I
should
have
kept
my
silence
,
for
the
only
purpose
my
words
served
was
to
demonstrate
my
disbelief
in
Billingsley
's
outrageous
explanation
.
That
disbelief
was
a
challenge
,
and
Deacon
Billingsley
was
not
a
man
to
resist
a
challenge
.
He
tipped
my
hand
with
his
own
strong
grasp
,
spilling
the
cartridge
cases
into
his
left
palm
,
then
,
one
by
one
,
he
tossed
the
cartridge
cases
overboard
.
"
You
have
a
boat
in
the
Bahamas
.
"
It
was
not
a
question
,
but
a
flat
statement
.
"
A
ketch
called
Masquerade
,
presently
marooned
on
Straker
's
Cay
.
"
"
She
's
not
marooned
,
"
I
said
,
"
she
's
under
repair
.
"
He
ignored
my
emendation
,
but
just
continued
to
toss
the
cartridge
cases
over
the
gunwale
.
"
And
how
will
you
repair
your
boat
,
Breakspear
,
or
even
take
her
away
,
if
I
put
your
name
on
the
Stop
List
?
You
do
know
what
the
Stop
List
is
,
Breakspear
?
"
I
knew
only
too
well
.
It
was
the
list
of
undesirable
aliens
who
were
banned
from
entering
the
Bahamas
,
and
if
my
name
was
put
on
that
Stop
List
,
and
if
I
was
then
thrown
off
the
islands
,
I
would
probably
never
see
my
boat
again
.
The
threat
was
effective
and
blunt
.
"
Do
you
understand
me
?
"
Billingsley
asked
as
he
threw
the
last
cartridge
overboard
.
I
suspected
that
as
soon
as
he
left
the
boatyard
the
chart
would
be
similarly
destroyed
.
Doubtless
Hirondelle
had
already
been
blown
up
,
just
as
my
own
boat
would
be
butchered
if
I
insisted
on
challenging
this
man
.
"
Do
you
understand
me
?
"
he
asked
a
second
time
.
"
Yes
.
"
I
tasted
the
sourness
of
humble
pie
.
"
So
do
you
still
find
anything
suspicious
in
the
circumstances
surrounding
your
discovery
of
the
yacht
Hirondelle
?
"
Billingsley
asked
with
a
mocking
punctiliousness
that
was
intended
to
humiliate
me
,
but
the
humiliation
was
my
own
fault
for
having
challenged
the
policeman
's
lie
.
"
No
,
"
I
said
,
and
hated
myself
for
telling
the
untruth
,
but
I
was
thinking
of
my
own
boat
standing
propped
on
the
sand
of
Straker
's
Cay
,
and
I
thought
of
all
the
work
I
had
lavished
on
Masquerade
,
and
of
all
the
love
and
care
and
time
I
had
poured
into
her
,
and
I
tried
to
imagine
her
rotting
under
the
tropical
sun
with
her
paint
peeling
,
her
deck
planks
opening
and
her
timbers
riddled
with
termites
.
So
I
lied
and
said
I
detected
nothing
untoward
in
finding
a
bullet-riddled
boat
awash
in
the
Bahamian
seas
.
Chief
Inspector
Deacon
Billingsley
raised
his
right
hand
and
victoriously
,
patronisingly
and
very
gently
,
patted
my
cheek
so
that
I
felt
the
cold
touch
of
his
heavy
gold
rings
.
"
Good
boy
,
"
he
said
derisively
.
"
And
when
you
see
Bellybutton
,
tell
him
that
I
know
where
his
brother
is
,
and
I
'll
pick
the
bastard
up
whenever
I
choose
and
then
feed
him
head
first
into
a
cane-shredder
.
"
He
turned
abruptly
away
,
not
waiting
for
any
answer
.
The
gangplank
bounced
under
his
confident
step
.
He
walked
down
the
quay
without
looking
back
,
but
he
must
have
known
I
was
watching
him
for
he
stopped
a
few
yards
short
of
his
car
and
very
ostentatiously
took
the
incriminating
chart
from
his
jacket
pocket
.
I
thought
for
a
second
he
was
going
to
burn
it
,
but
instead
he
tore
it
into
tiny
scraps
that
he
tossed
into
the
warm
wind
.
"
The
bastard
,
"
I
breathed
.
In
that
moment
,
Hirondelle
and
her
crew
had
disappeared
for
good
.
The
Lincoln
's
driver
was
a
uniformed
constable
who
climbed
into
the
sunlight
to
open
the
car
door
for
Billingsley
.
"
I
told
you
not
to
bother
,
"
Ellen
said
disparagingly
as
she
climbed
the
main
companionway
,
and
I
guessed
that
she
had
been
listening
to
my
conversation
with
Billingsley
by
standing
just
under
the
saloon
skylight
which
was
propped
open
.
Now
she
stood
beside
me
and
watched
the
white
Lincoln
drive
out
of
the
boatyard
.
"
Did
n't

say
you
'd

I
said
angrily
.

"
"
Of
course
I
heard

"
She
seemed
quite
unfazed
by
Billingsley
's
impertinent
question
whether
we
slept
together
,
doubtless
translating
the
policeman
's
particular
curiosity
as
a
general
confirmation
of
men
's
innate
tackiness
.
Ellen
was
more
irritated
by
my
answer
than
by
Billingsley
's
question
.
"

did
n't

truth

Which
was
that
Ellen
had
sworn
herself
to
celibacy
while
she
worked
as
a
cook
,
a
decision
that
was
to
me
as
eccentric
as
it
was
both
incomprehensible
and
frustrating
.
"
I

I
stared
at
the
empty
yard
where
Billingsley
's
car
had
stood
.
"

Ellen
was
genuinely
frightened
for
me
,
but
she
was
also
indignant
at
me
.
"

institutionalised
brutality
beneath
a
respectable
fiction

"
But
I
was
not
listening
to
the
professor
's
explanation
.
I
was
feeling
disgust
at
myself
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
the
stench
of
Billingsley
's
cigar
smoke
clung
to
the
boat
like
the
sulphurous
reek
of
the
pit
,
and
with
it
lingered
the
realisation
that
I
had
been
twisted
into
dishonesty
as
easily
as
a
length
of
rope
could
be
coiled
into
hanks
.
I
had
lied
,
and
I
had
let
myself
be
used
by
evil
.
But
all
for
Masquerade
.
Masquerade
is
my
boat
.
She
's
a
beauty
;
a
forty-foot
ketch
built
of
mahogany
on
oak
.
She
had
been
constructed
in
Hampshire
before
the
Second
World
War
by
craftsmen
who
had
taken
pride
in
their
work
,
but
fibreglass
had
made
wooden
boats
redundant
and
Masquerade
had
been
laid
up
and
left
to
rot
at
a
boatyard
on
the
River
Exe
.
I
had
found
her
when
I
was
a
Weapons
Instructor
at
the
Royal
Marines
'
Lympstone
camp
in
Devon
.
I
had
bought
her
for
a
song
,
then
spent
a
fortune
restoring
her
and
,
when
my
term
of
service
expired
and
I
could
afford
to
become
the
gypsy-sailor
I
had
always
wanted
to
be
,
I
left
the
Marines
and
made
Masquerade
my
new
home
.
For
a
couple
of
years
she
and
I
had
knocked
around
the
Mediterranean
,
then
I
had
sailed
her
across
the
Atlantic
.
That
voyage
had
been
the
first
leg
of
a
planned
circumnavigation
,
but
those
dreams
had
been
brutally
shattered
when
Masquerade
was
stolen
from
an
anchorage
in
the
Florida
Keys
.
She
turned
up
ten
days
later
,
stranded
on
a
coral
reef
in
the
Bahamas
with
most
of
her
gear
missing
and
her
starboard
bilges
half
ripped
out
by
the
savage
coral
heads
.
The
thieves
were
never
found
.
That
theft
and
recovery
had
taken
place
just
over
a
year
ago
.
Now
,
laboriously
rescued
by
Thessy
's
father
,
a
fisherman
,
Masquerade
was
standing
in
the
sandy
backyard
of
Thessy
's
house
where
she
was
cradled
by
timber
props
among
the
casuarinas
and
palm
trees
,
and
where
chickens
roosted
in
her
cockpit
.
She
needed
repairs
and
she
needed
love
.
She
needed
to
feel
the
sea
about
her
long
deep
keel
again
.
Her
timbers
needed
to
swell
with
the
salt
water
.
She
needed
me
.
Which
was
why
I
had
bowed
to
the
imperative
of
Deacon
Billingsley
's
dishonesty
,
because
otherwise
I
would
have
lost
her
.
And
I
would
have
lost
the
chance
to
sail
across
the
Pacific
with
Ellen
,
because
Ellen
was
on
the
verge
of
agreeing
to
come
with
me
,
and
if
I
had
not
yielded
to
the
policeman
's
blackmail
I
would
have
lost
Ellen
as
well
as
my
boat
.
And
so
I
had
lied
.
A
few
moments
before
sundown
I
extricated
Wavebreaker
's
folding
bicycle
from
the
big
locker
on
the
boat
's
after
swim-platform
,
forced
the
rusting
hinges
open
,
then
pedalled
along
Midshipman
Road
to
the
glittering
block
of
apartments
where
our
esteemed
boss
lived
.
Matthew
McIllvanney
was
not
the
real
boss
of
Cutwater
Yacht
Charters
(
Bahamas
)
Limited
,
which
belonged
to
a
retired
theatre
owner
who
now
lived
in
Bermuda
and
was
a
long-time
friend
of
my
father
,
a
friendship
that
had
secured
me
the
job
of
skippering
Wavebreaker
when
Masquerade
was
wrecked
,
but
McIllvanney
actually
looked
after
the
day-to-day
running
of
the
charter
business
.
Cutwater
's
charter
bookings
were
usually
made
by
agencies
in
Fort
Lauderdale
and
London
,
then
faxed
to
McIllvanney
's
yard
in
Freeport
where
the
boats
were
docked
and
maintained
.
McIllvanney
also
kept
a
few
power-cruisers
of
his
own
for
charter
,
and
his
yard
ran
an
efficient
yacht-servicing
and
marine
supplies
business
,
and
thus
the
boundaries
between
his
operations
and
Cutwater
Charters
were
necessarily
blurred
and
,
for
all
intents
and
purposes
,
he
could
have
been
said
to
run
Cutwater
.
He
also
ran
a
couple
of
other
businesses
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
boats
and
were
probably
much
more
profitable
.
McIllvanney
was
certainly
making
money
from
somewhere
.
Starkisser
had
to
have
cost
him
close
to
a
hundred
thousand
US
dollars
,
and
the
Lucaya
penthouse
apartment
,
with
its
private
docks
and
its
view
towards
Silver
Point
Beach
,
probably
cost
ten
times
as
much
.
He
kept
a
BMW
and
an
old
open-top
MG
in
the
garage
,
though
his
vehicle
of
choice
was
a
big
Kawasaki
motorbike
.
Matthew
McIllvanney
,
even
by
the
standards
of
the
expatriate
retired
Americans
who
lived
all
around
him
,
was
a
rich
man
.
I
chained
Wavebreaker
's
bicycle
to
an
ornamental
fence
outside
McIllvanney
's
apartment
block
,
and
persuaded
the
uniformed
ape
on
security
that
I
was
not
a
terrorist
.
The
ape
keyed
the
lift
panel
so
that
the
elevator
would
go
to
the
very
top
floor
where
it
opened
directly
into
McIllvanney
's
apartment
.
I
had
visited
the
apartment
at
least
a
dozen
times
,
but
I
still
found
the
fact
of
a
lift
opening
directly
into
a
living
room
incredibly
impressive
;
a
proof
of
wealth
as
convincing
as
the
possession
of
gold
taps
or
of
mink
rugs
or
of
the
girl
who
waited
to
greet
me
just
beyond
the
lift
doors
.
She
was
a
very
tall
and
very
fair
and
dazzlingly
beautiful
creature
whose
skin
was
goose-pimpled
under
the
impact
of
McIllvanney
's
air
conditioning
which
was
set
to
a
level
that
might
have
made
a
penguin
shiver
.
"
Hi
!
"
she
said
enthusiastically
.
"
You
've
got
to
be
Nick
!
Matt
's
expecting
you
.
He
's
right
outside
.
"
The
girl
,
who
looked
as
though
she
had
been
made
in
heaven
out
of
peaches
and
cream
,
was
wearing
a
few
pieces
of
string
arranged
as
a
bikini
,
high
heels
,
the
goose-pimples
,
and
nothing
else
.
She
nodded
towards
the
screened
porch
that
overlooked
the
sea
.
"
You
'll
have
a
drinkie
,
Nick

"
"
You

My
name

Donna
.
"
Donna
gave
me
a
limpid
hand
to
shake
,
then
wiggled
her
way
towards
the
liquor
cabinet
.
just
to
watch
her
walk
threatened
to
break
your
heart
.
She
waved
a
hand
about
McIllvanney
's
apartment
.
"
Is
n't
this
just
the
cutest
place
you
ever
did
see
,
Nick
?
"
"
It
's
very
splendid
,
"
I
agreed
politely
.
The
apartment
was
indeed
attractive
,
perhaps
because
it
had
nothing
whatever
of
McIllvanney
about
it
.
The
apartment
's
previous
owners
had
hired
an
expensive
interior
designer
from
New
York
and
ordered
her
to
trick
out
the
rooms
in
a
horse-country
olde-English
Spy-Cartoons
look
,
which
had
been
done
to
extravagant
perfection
,
but
McIllvanney
was
none
of
those
things
.
McIllvanney
was
a
Protestant
bully
from
the
Shankill
Road
in
Belfast
,
who
had
learned
his
thuggery
in
the
hard
school
of
Northern
Ireland
's
prejudices
,
honed
it
in
the
British
army
,
and
now
put
it
to
whatever
good
use
he
wanted
in
the
Bahamas
.
If
I
had
been
asked
to
decorate
a
flat
to
reflect
McIllvanney
's
character
then
I
would
have
given
him
an
East
Belfast
bar
with
sawdust
scattered
on
the
floor
,
King
Billy
strutting
on
the
walls
,
and
blood
splattered
across
its
tobacco-stained
ceiling
.
"
Why
do
n't
you
just
go
on
through
,
Nick
,
"
Donna
invited
me
,
"
and
I
'll
bring
you
and
Matt
your
drinkies
.
"
I
went
on
through
,
sliding
the
heavy
plate
glass
aside
to
walk
on
to
the
humid
porch
where
a
morose
looking
McIllvanney
slouched
in
a
cane
chair
and
stared
through
the
insect
screens
at
the
darkening
sea
.
"
It
's
you
,
"
he
greeted
me
without
delight
and
as
though
he
had
been
expecting
someone
else
.
"
You
wanted
to
see
me
,
"
I
pointed
out
.
Spending
time
with
McIllvanney
was
not
my
idea
of
relaxation
,
and
I
did
n't
much
take
to
his
lack
of
enthusiasm
.
"
Sit
down
,
"
he
said
grudgingly
,
"
your
Holiness
.
"
Calling
me
"
your
Holiness
"
was
McIllvanney
's
joke
.
It
was
not
because
I
was
particularly
pious
,
but
rather
because
my
namesake
,
Nicholas
Breakspear
,
had
been
the
only
Englishman
who
had
ever
become
Pope
.
He
had
taken
the
name
Adrian
IV
and
had
ruled
the
church
in
the
twelfth
century
,
a
fact
that
very
few
people
other
than
myself
knew
,
but
a
fact
I
had
been
foolish
enough
to
tell
McIllvanney
whose
hatred
of
"
taigs
"
,
Catholics
,
ensured
he
would
never
forget
my
papal
connection
.
In
truth
there
was
no
connection
,
for
my
original
family
name
was
Sillitoe
,
but
,
long
before
I
was
born
,
my
father
had
adopted
Breakspear
as
his
stage
name
and
I
had
really
known
no
other
.
"
Did
that
focker
Bellybutton
bring
Starkisser
back
?
"
McIllvanney
suddenly
demanded
of
me
in
his
sour
Belfast
accent
.
"
In
one
piece
,
even
.
"
"
He
's
getting
too
big
for
his
focking
black
boots
,
that
feller
is
.
"
The
complaint
was
a
ritual
,
not
to
be
taken
seriously
,
a
mere
habitual
statement
made
solely
to
impress
on
me
how
tough
McIllvanney
was
.
If
he
had
to
choose
between
me
and
Bellybutton
,
or
between
Bellybutton
and
his
own
mother
,
he
would
have
chosen
Bellybutton
any
day
.
They
were
two
of
a
kind
.
McIllvanney
was
a
tall
,
harshly
scarred
and
surprisingly
handsome
man
,
with
a
hard
knowing
face
and
a
deceptively
thin
body
.
It
was
deceptive
for
he
was
brutally
strong
.
He
could
also
be
excellent
company
,
with
a
fund
of
stories
that
he
told
with
an
exquisite
sense
of
timing
,
though
such
good
moments
were
rare
for
he
preferred
to
brood
savagely
over
life
's
injustices
;
the
chief
of
which
was
the
inexplicable
existence
of
Roman
Catholics
.
"
Are
you
a
Catholic
?
"
he
asked
Donna
as
she
brought
out
the
drinks
.
I
suspected
the
question
was
meant
for
my
amusement
rather
than
for
his
own
enlightenment
.
"
Gracious

In
our
family

"
She
gave
him
a
big
smile

"
From
Philadelphia
,
"
she
added
for
my
benefit
and
with
yet
another
winning
smile
.
Donna
was
one
of
life
's
cheerleaders
;
her
teeth
were
a
triumph
of
the
orthodontic
trade
,
her
hair
was
a
confection
of
gel
,
spray
and
heat
,
and
her
body
was
a
tribute
to
wholesome
American
food
and
exercise
.
"
I
've
heard
so
much
about

"
she
said
to
me
,
as
though
settling
herself
in
for
a
long
cosy
chat
.
"
So
now
fock
away
off

him
,
"
McIllvanney
snapped
at
her
.
"
It
's
just
been
so
nice
visiting
with
you
,
Nick

"
Donna
gave
me
a
last
dazzling
smile
,
then
,
apparently
impervious
to
McIllvanney
's
evil-tempered
scorn
,
clicked
away
on
her
ridiculously
high
heels
.
I
waited
till
Donna
was
safely
out
of
earshot
.
"
Is
she
your
newest
?
"
Pretty
girls
moved
through
McIllvanney
's
life
at
an
astonishing
rate
,
though
the
last
,
who
had
endured
a
record
six
months
,
had
left
just
a
few
weeks
before

He
shook
his
head
.
"
She

the
girls

thousand
US
a
day

Nick
,
plus
air-fare
,
food
and
a
present

I
had
to
bring
her
over
from
Miami
today
because
the
stupid
cow
wo
n't
fly

Can
you
believe
that

She
's
frightened
of
airplanes
,
so
she
is
!
So
I
had
to
fetch
her
in
Junkanoo
.
"
Junkanoo
was
one
of
McIllvanney
's
boats
,
doubtless
purchased
on
the
profits
of
his
call-girl
service
.
He
liked
to
boast
that
the
service
was
very
elegant
,
and
certainly
not
crude
like
the
part-time
pimp
service
that
Bellybutton
enforced
with
his
teeth
.
Instead
McIllvanney
was
the
Bahamian
agent
for
a
Miami-based
business
that
claimed
to
provide
the
world
's
most
beautiful
girls
to
anyone
with
the
money
to
pay
for
them
.
McIllvanney
arranged
the
girls
'
visits
to
clients
in
the
Bahamas
and
guaranteed
their
safety
while
they
were
in
the
islands
.
That
made
McIllvanney
a
gold-plated
pimp
,
though
he
preferred
to
describe
himself
as
a
"
leisure-agent
"
;
however
,
he
usually
had
the
grace
to
smile
when
he
used
that
label
.
He
showed
a
similar
amusement
now
.
"
I

black
bugger

the
living
daylights

"
McIllvanney
enjoyed
making
the
accusation
.
He
did
not
like
me
.
I
was
the
son
of
a
rich
and
famous
man
and
,
to
McIllvanney
,
that
accident
of
birth
clinked
with
the
corrupt
sound
of
silver
spoons
.
It
did
not
matter
that
I
had
rejected
my
father
's
ways
,
that
I
had
become
a
marine
and
was
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
while
McIllvanney
had
become
a
rich
man
;
the
stench
of
privilege
still
clung
to
me
and
McIllvanney
loved
to
discomfort
me
because
of
it
.
"
How

asked
him

small
as
Grand
Bahamas
two
men

McIllvanney

Billingsley
would
know
each

McIllvanney
must
have
been
Billingsley
's
source
for
the
policeman
's
information
about
my
boat
and
my
plans
to
repair
her
.
Doubtless
,
before
coming
to
the
yard
,
Billingsley
had
talked
with
McIllvanney
,
and
I
guessed
that
he
had
also
entertained
the
Ulsterman
afterwards
with
an
account
of
my
pusillanimity
.
I
suddenly
felt
an
immense
relief
that
I
only
had
one
more
charter
to
complete
for
Cutwater
,

that
I
would
then
be
free
of
these
men

"

McIllvanney
seemed
amused

my
silence

the

off

Yes

the
wrong

saw
something

guilty

easily

glared

daring

kept
a
cowardly
silence

was
broken

a
strident
and
sudden
eruption
of
Goombay
music
from
one
of
the
nearby

music

applause

Man
's

"
He
had
added
the
last
three
words
with
the
same
morose
carelessness
with
which
he
had
decried
the
car
dealers
'
convention
,
but
he
offered
no
elucidation
as
to
what
the
words
meant
.
"
Who
is
?
"
I
finally
asked
.
"
Deacon
Billingsley
,
of
course
.
He
's
as
tough
as
old
boots
,
but
playing
with
drugs
is
still
a
mug
's
game
.

the
spics
do
n't
blow
you
away
then
the
Americans
will
.
The
man
's
a
prick
to
be
involved
.
"
"
So
he
is
involved
?
"
I
asked
,
and
I
was
unable
to
hide
my
surprise
even
though
McIllvanney
was
merely
confirming
my
own
suspicion
that
Billingsley
was
corrupt
.
Yet
suspecting
and
knowing
are
two
different
things
,
and
I
was
still
naive
enough
to
want
to
believe
that
all
policemen
could
be
trusted
.
Ellen
was
amused
by
my
naivety
,
claiming
that
if
she
dug
deep
enough
she
would
probably
discover
that
I
still
believed
in
Santa
Claus
.
I
did
not
like
the
accusation
of
naivety
,
preferring
to
believe
that
I
was
an
honest
man
who
found
it
hard
to
imagine
how
other
people
could
live
with
a
guilty
conscience
.
Whatever
,
I
sounded
primly
shocked
at
hearing
my
suspicions
of
Billingsley
's
corruption
confirmed
.
McIllvanney
stared
at
me
as
though
I
was
a
complete
idiot
.
"
Of
course
he
's
focking
involved
.
He
's
up
to
his
black
eyeballs
in
the
drug
trade
.
He
's
even
got
a
house
on
Murder
Cay
,
so
he
has
,
and
he
's
not
the
only
one
with
his
nose
stuck
in
that
particular
trough
,
but
it
's
not
your
business
,
and
you
do
n't
mess
with
the
man
because
he
's
got
friends
who
wo
n't
think
twice
about
feeding
you
to
the
sharks
.
I
've
got
a
job
for
you
.
"
I
almost
ignored
his
last
words
because
I
was
still
thinking
about
Billingsley
's
dishonesty
,
but
then
I
realised
just
what
McIllvanney
had
said
and
I
frowned
.
"
A

"

the

I
said
instantly
and
very
firmly
.
McIllvanney
did
not
respond
,
except
to
stare
at
me
with
his
unblinking
and
reptilian
eyes
,
and
thus
he
forced
me
to
add
an
unnecessary
explanation
.
"
I

That
was
entirely
true
,

it
sounded
very

I
said
it

my
voice
just
tailed
away
.

"

McIllvanney
said
flatly
.
He
was
not
looking
at
me
any
more
,
but
was
staring
out
to
sea
where
a
small
tanker
,
her
navigation
lights
glowing
bright
in
the
falling
darkness

nudged
gingerly
towards

I
began

me
off

I
was
doing
some
swift
mental

the
result
was
so
crazy
that
I
paused
to
rework
the
sums

my
head

The

salesmen
cheered
from

You
remember
Senator

"
"
Of
course
I
do
.
"
I
remembered
George
Crowninshield
very
well
,
for
he
and
his
wife
had
been
my
very
first
clients
on
board
Wavebreaker
and
I
had
been
nervous
,
not
just
at
the
prospect
of
a
new
job
,
but
because
of
the
client
's
eminence
.
George
Crowninshield
was
a
US
senator
,
one
of
the
stars
of
that
legislature
,
and
these
days
it
was
impossible
to
see
his
name
in
a
magazine
or
newspaper
without
the
added
speculation
that
he
might
soon
become
the
President
of
the
United
States
.
He
was
not
the
clear
favourite
for
the
Oval
Office
,
for
there
were
other
men
whose
achievements
were
more
palpable
than
George
Crowninshield
's
,
but
he
looked
good
,
sounded
better
and
no
journalist
had
ever
discovered
him
with
his
fingers
in
the
till
or
his
legs
in
the
wrong
bed
.
His
enemies
said
that
he
was
a
politician
without
a
cause
,
but
if
that
was
the
worst
they
could
say
of
him
then
he
could
indeed
look
towards
the
White
House
.
I
had
liked
the
senator
.
I
had
expected
an
American
senator
to
be
as
pompous
and
flatulent
as
a
British
MP
,
but
George
Crowninshield
had
proved
affable
and
friendly
.
He
had
been
intrigued
by
my
relationship
with
my
father
,
and
sympathetic
to
my
rejection
of
the
theatre
.
My
father
,
Sir
Tom
,
was
the
second
most
famous
man
of
the
British
stage
,
of
any
stage
for
that
matter
;
a
towering
and
famous
figure
,
one
of
the
great
actors
of
all
time
,
who
accepted
the
adulation
as
his
due
and
who
had
expected
me
,
like
the
rest
of
his
children
,
to
follow
in
his
footsteps
.
Instead
,
in
rebellion
against
the
illusions
of
the
stage
and
films
,
I
had
run
away
from
home
and
joined
the
Marines
.
Not
as
an
officer
,
but
as
a
marine
.
Sir
Tom
had
tried
to
get
me
out
,
had
failed
,
and
had
then
left
me
to
my
own
devices
.
What
hurt
him
was
how
much
I
looked
like
him
.
I
,
the
only
one
of
his
children
who
had
not
gone
on
to
the
stage
,
had
inherited
the
famous
Breakspear
eyes
,
the
Breakspear
height
,
the
Breakspear
cheekbones
,
the
brooding
Breakspear
presence
that
my
father
had
used
to
break
the
hearts
of
unnumbered
women
.
I
was
often
called
Hamlet
because
I
so
resembled
my
father
's
appearance
in
his
most
famous
film
,
the
"
Coronation
"
Hamlet
,
so
named
because
it
had
been
released
in
Coronation
year
.
Yet
I
was
not
my
father
.
I
was
an
ex-marine
sergeant
who
was
also
a
damned
good
sailor
.
Senator
Crowninshield
had
been
sympathetic
to
the
problems
a
child
might
have
with
a
famous
parent
.
The
senator
had
a
son
and
daughter
of
his
own
and
,
though
he
had
never
talked
specifically
of
their
problems
,
I
sensed
that
in
my
life
he
was
seeking
an
answer
to
his
own
family
's
complexities
.
He
and
I
had
talked
long
into
the
tropical
nights
and
I
had
enjoyed
his
company
,
and
I
would
have
liked
to
have
spent
more
time
with
Senator
Crowninshield
,
but
three
months
?
"
Just
how
can
a
US
senator
take
off
from
his
job
for
three
months
?
"
I
now
asked
McIllvanney
in
astonishment
"
The
senator
does
n't
want
the
boat
for
himself
.
"
McIllvanney
shook
a
cigarette
out
of
a
packet
,
then
opened
his
briefcase
that
lay
on
the
floor
beside
his
chair
.
"

He
had
found
his
lighter
in
the
briefcase
,
as
well
as
a

was
embossed
with
a

gold
eagle
above
the
rubric
"

.
McIllvanney
held
the
letter

it
explained
everything
.

"
I
knew
exactly
what
he
meant
,
and
I
felt
a
seething
of
anger
at
his
suggestion
.
"
Ask
her
yourself
.
I
wo
n't
bloody
pimp
for
you
.
"
I
snatched
his
sliding
door
open
and
went
back
into
the
arctic
cold
where
I
punched
the
button
to
summon
the
lift
.
Donna
was
on
the
telephone
.
She
smiled
at
me
as
the
lift
doors
opened
,
then
mouthed
a
silent
farewell
and
fluttered
her
fingers
at
me
till
the
lift
doors
closed
.
I
rode
the
bicycle
back
to
the
darkened
and
empty
boatyard
.
Ellen
had
gone
to
her
one-room
apartment
in
town
while
Thessy
was
reading
his
Bible
in
the
main-cabin
,
so
I
heated
myself
some
baked
beans
in
Wavebreaker
's
microwave
,
spread
them
on
buttered
toast
,
soaked
them
in
brown
sauce
,
then
ate
a
morose
supper
on
deck
until
the
bugs
drove
me
to
the
screened
sanctuary
of
the
staterooms
below
.
Thessy
asked
me
what
McIllvanney
had
wanted
,
but
I
said
it
had
been
nothing
very
much
for
I
was
too
disgusted
with
the
man
to
tell
Thessy
the
truth
.
I
felt
dirtied
by
the
corruption
of
pimps
,
yet
I
would
soon
be
free
of
them
for
I
had
just
one
more
job
to
do
,
and
then
I
would
be
loosed
to
the
consolations
of
Masquerade
and
to
the
joys
of
the
South
Pacific
's
winds
.
Just
one
more
job
;
then
home
to
the
sea
.
Next
morning
the
sky
was
clear
,
the
wind
steady
,
and
the
barometer
high
.
The
customers
'
beds
were
made
,
the
galley
was
stocked
,
and
the
black
scorch
marks
of
Deacon
Billingsley
's
matches
had
been
scrubbed
out
of
Wavebreaker
's
pale
decks
.
Her
fuel
tanks
were
filled
with
diesel
,
the
last
fresh
water
was
aboard
,
there
was
sun-tan
lotion
and
lip-salve
in
every
cabin
,
and
the
rotted
chicken
heads
were
safe
in
the
freezer
.
We
were
ready
.
McIllvanney
made
his
usual
inspection
.
Wavebreaker
was
the
flagship
of
Cutwater
's
fleet
and
McIllvanney
liked
to
see
her
sparkling
before
each
charter
.
That
morning
,
as
usual
,
he
found
nothing
to
complain
of
,
so
instead
he
wheeled
on
me
to
demand
whether
the
boat
's
electronic
instruments
were
functioning
properly
.
"
Ask
Ellen
,
"
I
replied
laconically
,
for
Ellen
was
the
only
person
who
truly
understood
all
the
fancy
gadgets
though
,
perversely
,
she
had
still
not
mastered
a
sextant
.
She
confirmed
to
McIllvanney
that
the
weather-fax
machine
and
the
Loran
and
the
Satnav
and
the
radar
and
all
the
other
things
that
hummed
and
winked
and
glowed
in
the
night
were
working
properly
.
McIllvanney
flicked
a
non-existent
scrap
of
dust
from
the
varnished
rail
,
then
gave
Thessy
a
sly
glance
.
"
I
suppose
His
Holiness
Pope
Breakspear
told
you
about
the
senator
's
offer
,
eh
,
Thessalonians
?
And
I
dare
say
you
're
disappointed
about
it
,
because
it
's
not
every
day
that
an
out-island
lad
gets
offered
that
sort
of
money
,
is
it
now
?
It
's
even
better
money
than
you
could
earn
in
high
season
,
so
it
is
,
but
of
course
your
father
is
n't
Sir
Thomas
Bloody
Breakspear
and
as
rich
as
a
pig
in
shit
,
so
you
need
the
money
,
while
his
Holiness
here
does
n't
.
And
the
senator
was
most
particular
in
wanting
Pope
Breakspear
.
No
one
else
,
the
senator
said
,
just
his
Holiness
.
"
McIllvanney
favoured
me
with
a
jackal-like
smile
.
Thessy
hesitated
,
torn
between
curiosity
and
his
loyalty
to
me
,
but
he
finally
shook
his
head
.
"
I
do
n't
know
about
the
senator
's
offer
,
sir
.
"
McIllvanney
pretended
astonishment
.
"
Did
I
speak
out
of
turn
?
That
's
terrible
,
if
I
did
.
Forget
I
even
spoke
.
"
He
shot
a
glance
at
Ellen
,
making
sure
that
she
had
understood
him
as
well
as
Thessy
,
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
shouted
for
Bellybutton
to
start
up
one
of
the
workboats
.
"
I
'll
see
you
in
a
week
's
time
,
so
I
will
.
"
He
gave
me
an
evil
grin
,
knowing
just
what
dissension
he
had
sown
in
Wavebreaker
's
crew
,
then
he
was
gone
.
"
What
offer
?
"
Ellen
asked
icily
when
McIllvanney
was
out
of
earshot
.
"
And
what
senator
?
"
So
,
just
as
McIllvanney
had
intended
,
I
was
forced
to
tell
Ellen
and
Thessy
about
George
Crowninshield
's
offer
,
and
how
the
senator
was
willing
to
pay
above
the
odds
if
we
would
all
abandon
our
summer
plans
and
take
his
precious
kids
to
sea
for
three
months
.
I
tried
to
make
the
prospect
unattractive
,
but
McIllvanney
's
vision
of
money
had
dazzled
both
Ellen
and
Thessy
.
"
Why
the
hell
did
you
say
no
?
"
Ellen
demanded
angrily
.
"
I
did
n't
say
no
.
I
just
said
I
could
n't
go
myself
!
But
I
told
McIllvanney
that
Sammy
Meredith
could
go
instead
of
me
.
"
Ellen
did
not
like
that
suggestion
.
Sammy
was
a
competent
skipper
,
but
he
could
not
keep
his
hands
to
himself
when
Ellen
was
close
.
Sammy
was
presently
delivering
one
of
our
Nautor
Swans
to
its
Massachusetts
owner
;
many
of
the
charter
yachts
were
privately
owned
and
only
leased
into
Cutwater
's
care
on
condition
that
we
delivered
them
back
to
their
owners
for
the
northern
summer
.
I
assumed
McIllvanney
had
sent
a
message
to
Massachusetts
asking
Sammy
to
telephone
as
soon
as
he
reached
port
,
and
I
was
certain
that
Sammy
would
jump
at
the
chance
of
three
months
'
extra
salary
,
and
if
he
did
then
Ellen
and
Thessy
would
similarly
earn
their
small
fortunes
.
"
But
Mr
McIllvanney
said
the
senator
vants
you
,
Nick
,
"
Thessy
said
unhappily
.
"
He
just
wants
someone
to
give
his
two
spoilt
brats
a
holiday
.
He
does
n't
care
who
skippers
the
boat
!
"
"
But
maybe
he
does
,
"
Thessy
insisted
sadly
,
and
both
he
and
Ellen
stared
reproachfully
at
me
as
though
I
was
risking
all
their
future
prosperity
.
"
For
God
's
sake
,
"
I
said
angrily
,
"
you
'll
both
get
your
money
.
Sammy
Meredith
will
jump
at
the
chance
of
three
months
"
work
.
I
ca
n't
do
it
,
OK
?
I
've
got
a
boat
to
mend
.
"
The
two
of
them
still
gazed
at
me
with
resentful
misunderstanding
.
Damn
McIllvanney
,
I
thought
,
and
damn
his
blackmail
.
I
turned
away
from
my
crew
to
demonstrate
that
I
would
not
discuss
the
Crowninshield
charter
any
further
.
"
Thessy
?
Put
up
the
flags
.
"
The
flags
were
our
final
welcoming
touch
.
Wavebreaker
was
registered
in
the
Channel
Islands
,
and
thus
sailed
under
a
defaced
British
red
ensign
with
the
Bahamian
flag
flying
as
a
courtesy
ensign
from
the
main
spreaders
,
but
I
always
greeted
arriving
charter
guests
with
their
own
country
's
flag
-
though
such
a
gesture
was
considered
bad
flag
etiquette
by
nautical
purists
,
it
was
good
for
our
final
tip
-
and
so
Thessy
now
hoisted
the
Stars
and
Stripes
to
the
mainmast
's
spreaders
and
a
smaller
Stars
and
Bars
just
beneath
.
The
Confederate
flag
had
been
Ellen
's
idea
,
to
be
unfurled
whenever
we
had
charterers
from
the
deep
South
,
and
this
week
's
guests
were
three
married
couples
from
Georgia
.
I
watched
the
two
handsome
flags
uncurl
to
the
warm
wind
,
then
went
on
my
own
tour
of
inspection
.
Wavebreaker
looked
good
,
and
we
,
her
crew
,
looked
just
as
good
in
our
matching
blue
and
white
clothes
.
We
were
ready
,
even
to
the
pitcher
of
orange
juice
,
bucket
of
champagne
and
iced
flask
of
vodka
that
waited
on
a
table
Ellen
had
carried
up
to
the
cockpit
.
The
wind
lifted
the
snow-white
tablecloth
and
stirred
the
handsome
red
ensign
at
Wavebreaker
's
stern
.
"
She
looks
good
,
"
I
told
my
crew
,
"
well
done

"
"
But

Crowninshield
wo
n't
accept
anyone

's
captain

"
Ellen
,
refusing
to
be
sidetracked
from
her
lost
dollars
,
asked
in
a
sulky
and
defiant
voice
.
The
question
annoyed
me
.
"
I
'm
supposed

"
No

earn
a

thousand
dollars

Ellen
smiled
very
sweetly
at
me
.
"
And
if
I
do
n't
earn
those
few
thousand
dollars

I

sure
as

not
going

sail
away
with
you

As
the
psalmist
says
,
dear
Nicholas
,
"
and
Ellen
's
smile
became
even
sweeter
,
"
you
can
blow
that
dream
right
up
your
ass

"
Thessy
gasped
at
such
blasphemy
,
while
I
scowled
at
Ellen
's
blackmail
.
"
You
can
earn
your
money

I
insisted

me
.
"
"
I
ca
n't

senator
demands
you

"
Ellen
said
stubbornly
,
then
turned
away
as
Cutwater
's
courtesy
taxi
arrived
from
the
airport
in
a
salvo
of
backfires
and
black
smoke
.
Thessy
slid
down
the
companionway
,
took
the
cassette
from
the
rack
,
and
waited
by
the
boat
's
sound
system
for
my
signal
.
The
taxi
doors
opened
.
We
knew
very
little
about
these
last
clients
of
the
season
except
that
they
were
two
attorneys
and
a
proctologist
,
all
from
Georgia
and
all
vacationing
with
their
wives
,
and
we
also
knew
that
one
of
the
wives
was
a
vegetarian
and
that
the
proctologist
hated
pasta
,
but
beyond
that
our
guests
were
utter
strangers
and
so
we
waited
nervously
to
see
what
kind
of
people
would
be
our
companions
and
paymasters
for
the
next
week
.
Doubtless
the
arriving
customers
were
just
as
anxious
about
us
,
and
part
of
our
job
was
to
relax
them
quickly
.
"
You
have
to
remember
,
"
Ellen
liked
to
lecture
Thessy
and
me
,
"
just
how
absurdly
wealthy
they
all
are
,
and
how
desperately
the
wealthy
want
to
be
liked
because
they
ca
n't
help
feeling
guilty
about
being
so
rich
,
so
we
only
have
to
be
obsequious
,
give
them
loads
of
booze
,
and
pretend
to
be
impressed
by
their
entirely
predictable
and
usually
jejune
opinions
,
after
which
they
'll
reward
us
with
an
outrageously
large
tip
-
which
is
,
after
all
,
the
sole
reason
for
being
nice
to
the
ghastly
creatures
in
the
first
place
.
"
The
first
man
out
of
the
Chevrolet
was
wearing
blue
and
green
Bermuda
shorts
,
a
pink
and
scarlet
Hawaiian
shirt
and
a
blue
tennis
visor
with
the
words
"

inscribed
on
its
peak

Ellen

sweetly

Thessy
,
ever
eager
to
extend
his
education

asked
from
the
foot
of
the
companionway
.
"
A
proctologist

asshole
doctor

Ellen
explained
,
then
gave
me
a
smile
that
would
have
frozen
the
heart
out
of
a
blast
furnace
.

I
interrupted
Thessy
's
next
earnest
question
,
and
he
pushed
the
cassette
into
the
tape
deck
and
a
steel
band
arrangement
of
"
Yellow

jaunty
welcome
.
Bellybutton
,
a
straw
hat
over
his
eyes
,
danced
a
few
ludicrous
steps
on
the
deck
of
the
workboat
,
thus
looking
for
all
the
world
like
a
simple
Bahamian
native
welcoming
the
nice
white
folks
from
Georgia
who
now
stood
blinking
in
the
bright
sunlight
beside
a
growing
mound
of
their
designer-label
luggage
.
The
man
with
the
"
Go
Dawgs
"
hat
saw
our
rebel
flag
at
the
spreaders
and
let
out
an
approving
yell
that
sent
two
gulls
squawking
up
from
the
garbage
cans
behind
McIllvanney
's
office
.
"
Asshole
,
"
the
Yankee
Ellen
said
scathingly
,
then
,
joined
by
Thessy
,
we
stepped
forward
to
offer
our
practised
and
smiling
welcome
.
My
last
charter
had
begun
;
I
had
one
week
to
work
,
then
it
would
be
back
to
Masquerade
,
and
then
to
the
long
winds
of
the
southern
ocean
that
led
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
,
and
thus
to
happiness
.
Wavebreaker
,
despite
her
ethereal
beauty
,
was
not
the
most
practical
boat
with
which
to
cruise
the
Bahamas
.
She
drew
too
much
water
,
and
the
Bahamas
,
for
the
most
part
,
are
a
shallow
bank
dotted
with
ripsaw
coral
heads
and
treacherous
shoals
where
flat-bottomed
boats
might
glide
in
comparative
safety
,
but
where
a
deep-keeled
schooner
was
forced
to
creep
with
painful
care
.
Whenever
we
reached
coral
or
shoal
waters
Thessy
was
forced
to
spend
hours
perched
at
the
foremast
's
lower
spreaders
to
watch
the
water
's
colour
.
Deep
safe
water
was
a
dark
royal
blue
,
while
over
a
coral
reef
the
sea
shaded
to
green
or
,
when
perilously
shallow
,
to
brown
,
and
Thessy
,
peering
ahead
,
would
shout
at
me
to
go
to
port
or
starboard
,
or
even
to
go
backwards
as
fast
as
the
motors
would
catch
hold
.
We
tried
to
avoid
such
adventures
by
sticking
to
the
deeper
channels
and
harbours
,
but
some
guests
demanded
we
anchor
in
the
shallower
lagoons
where
the
rays
glided
above
the
bright
sand
and
the
grey
snappers
schooled
and
the
barracudas
patrolled
.
One
way
to
discourage
such
demands
was
secretly
to
salt
a
shallow
anchorage
with
a
bag
of
rotted
chicken
heads
which
would
quickly
draw
a
sinuous
and
evil-looking
pack
of
otherwise
harmless
sand
sharks
that
would
twist
menacingly
under
our
keel
and
persuade
the
paying
customers
to
seek
the
deeper
darker
waters
offshore
.
Guests
who
still
wanted
to
explore
the
lagoons
and
sea-flats
could
use
Wavebreaker
's
skiff
.
Our
Georgia
guests
used
the
small
flat-bottomed
craft
to
go
bonefishing
one
afternoon
,
and
Thessy
,
well
trained
by
his
father
,
led
them
unerringly
to
a
sea-flat
by
a
mangrove
swamp
where
,
in
just
a
few
heart-racing
moments
,
they
landed
four
of
the
gleaming
and
elusive
fish
.
None
weighed
more
than
three
pounds
,
but
the
sheer
savage
strength
of
the
mirror-plated
fish
astonished
our
guests
.
"
Hey

the
proctologist
,
back
aboard
Wavebreaker
at
sunset
,
called
down
the
companionway
steps
to
where
Ellen
was
tearing
apart
a
lettuce
for
the
evening
meal
.

Ellen
gave
him
her
sweetest
smile
,

one
calculated
to
provoke
cardiac
arrest
in
a
sworn
celibate
.

He
chuckled
,
then
held
his
glass
out
for
a
refill
of
vodka
and
orange
juice
.
Once
the
glass
was
full
he
held
it
up
to
the
lantern
that
hung
from
the
awning
's
strut
and
toasted
whichever
patient
had
paid
for
that
afternoon
's
bonefishing
.
All
week
our
doctor
and
two
lawyers
had
thus
credited
their
clients
for
their
various
pleasures
.
The
proctologist
drank
the
toast
,
then
raised
his
glass
once
more
,
this
time
in
tribute
to
Thessy
's
prowess
as
a
bonefish

The
proctologist
shook
his
head
then
turned
to
look
at
our
private
scrap
of
paradise
.
The
evening
was
dropping
like
velvet
and
the
lagoon
was
fading
to
a
deep
dusky
richness
in
which
the
curving
palms
were
reflected
as
cleanly
as
though
the
water
were
a
dark-silvered
looking-glass
.
We
had
moored
off
a
deserted
cay
rimmed
with
a
beach
of
clear
sand
above
which
the
first
stars
were
pricking
the
warm
sky
,
while

clinked
in

The
proctologist
stretched
his
sunburned
legs
on
the
cockpit
cushions
and
rested
his
head
so
he
could
stare
past

The
proctologist
hooted
at
his
own
wit
before
asking
which
of
my
father
's
famous
wives
was

told

I
agreed

In
her
time
Mother
had
been
almost
as
famous
as

,
but
presently
she
was
in
a
home
for
inebriates
where
,
on
good
days
,
she
could
remember
who
she
was
,
but
the
good
days
were
very
rare
and
getting
scarcer
.
I
thought
what
a
snakepit
my
family
was
;
a
snakepit
dominated
by
a
genius
who
knew
how
to
create
any
illusion

even
love

nodded
agreement

He
was
entirely
serious

had
adopted
a
portentous
tone
suitable
for
expressing
admiration
for
the
Greatest

was
too
,

not
for
the
reasons
the
proctologist
believed

I
was
lucky
because
I
had
turned
my
back
on
illusion
,
pursuing
instead
common-sense
reality
.
I
had
run
away
from

because
I
needed
to
find
a
bedrock
of
truth
on
which
to
build
a
life
.
I
had
no
time
for

could
not
fix
a
position
from

reading

fight
two
hundred
square
feet
of
heavy
flogging
wet

tumbling
sea

a
rough
wind

People
envied
me
my
birth

my
childhood

my
secret
pride
was
that
I
had
rejected
both
to
make
of
myself
a
prosaic
and
common-sense
fellow
.
The
proctologist
was
bored
with
talking
about
Sir
Tom
.
"

the

shouted
down
to
the
galley

was
trying
to
disguise
the
fact

the
frozen
steaks
were

thawed

"
By
the
week
's
end
the
proctologist
was
saying
that
it
had
been
the
best
goddamned
vacation
he
had
ever
taken
,
and
as
we
passed
the
bunkering
moorings
near
McIllvanney
's
yard
I
saw
him
take
Ellen
aside
and
I
guessed
he
was
offering
her
a
job
.
In
the
year
I
had
skippered
Wavebreaker
at
least
half
of
our
married
male
charterers
had
either
offered
Ellen
a
job
or
pressed
her
to
visit
their
offices
the
next
time
she
passed
through
their
city
.
It
was
almost
tedious
to
watch
it
happen
.
We
docked
ten
minutes
later
,
and
Thessy
and
I
carried
the
luggage
out
to
the
yard
where
the
courtesy
taxi
shimmered
in
the
heat
.
One
of
the
lawyers
'
wives
wanted
to
know
the
secret
of
Ellen
's
coffee
,
and
Ellen
modestly
said
she
just
followed
the
percolator
instructions
,
while
the
truth
was
that
she
put
a
cupful
of
cheap
instant
coffee
powder
into
every
percolated
pot
.
The
proctologist
handed
me
three
envelopes
,
one
addressed
to
each
of
us
,
then
told
me
that
if
I
ever
had
piles
I
could
rely
on
him
to
cut
them
out
for
cost
.
Ellen
held
her
happy
smile
till
the
courtesy
taxi
had
disappeared
,
then
she
tore
up
the
proctologist
's
business
card
.
"
The
creep
suggested
I
might
be
his
receptionist
.
"
She
ripped
open
her
envelope
to
find
two
hundred
dollars
.
Mine
had
the
same
amount
,
while
Thessy
's
only
contained
a
hundred
,
though
the
proctologist
had
also
given
him
the
"
Go
Dawgs
"
hat
.
Not
that
the
inequity
of
the
tip
mattered
,
for
we
always
pooled
and
shared
the
money
evenly
.
It
took
just
over
an
hour
to
empty
Wavebreaker
of
her
garbage
and
dirty
linen
,
and
then
to
hook
up
the
shoreside
electricity
and
pump
diesel
and
fresh
water
into
her
tanks
.
Those
chores
done
,
and
the
synthetic
fabric
of
the
precious
sails
covered
from
the
ravages
of
sunlight
,
I
hefted
my
old
marine
kit
bag
on
to
the
dock
where
Ellen
was
waiting
to
ambush
me
.
Ellen
planned
to
return
to
her
tiny
apartment
in
the
town
where
she
kept
her
precious
books
and
where
,
on
an
old
manual
typewriter
,
she
wrote
what
she
called
her
"
five-finger
exercises
"
,
which
she
would
never
let
anyone
read
.
McIllvanney
had
offered
to
let
her
stay
on
board
Wavebreaker
,
so
long
as
the
boat
's
air
conditioners
were
disconnected
,
but
his
offer
was
not
as
generous
as
it
seemed
for
Ellen
would
have
been
little
more
than
an
unpaid
security
guard
and
also
subject

Thessy
was
already
waiting
at
the
yard
gate
where
our
taxi
thumped
and
quivered
.
Ellen
was
still
arguing
with
me
as
Thessy
and
I
climbed
in
and
backfired
away
,
but
I
was
no
longer
listening
.
I
had
Masquerade
to
mend
and
a
life
to
live
and
,
even
if
it
meant
living
it
without
Ellen
,
my
charter
days
were
done
.
I
was
free
.
I
had
been
in
New
York
when
Masquerade
was
stolen
.
I
had
gone
there
from
Florida
because
my
father
had
pleaded
with
me
to
go
.
He
was
opening
his
celebrated
King
Lear
on
Broadway
.
He
was
old
,
he
told
me
,
and
he
was
feeling
his
age
,
and
he
had
played
the
Lear
for
five
months
at
the
National
in
London
and
he
was
tired
,
and
he
wanted
to
patch
things
up
with
me
because
it
would
make
him
feel
better
,
and
I
was
the
only
one
of
all
his
children
whom
he
could
trust
,
and
he
needed
my
youth
to
support
him
at
this
difficult
time
and
so
,
like
a
fool
,
I
had
believed
him
and
flown
to
New
York
where
I
had
found
the
rogue
ensconced
in
a
suite
of
the
Plaza
with
a
frizzy-haired
girl
young
enough
to
be
his
great-granddaughter
.
"
The
dear
soul
wishes
to
be
in
the
theatre

he
told
me
,
"
and
her
legs
are
good
enough
to
allow
me
to
encourage
that
ambition
,
though
doubtless
at
the
risk
of
slipping
a
disc
or
two
in
my
back
.
Would
you
like
to
sleep
with
her
?
"
I
went
to
his
opening
night
.
He
was
brilliant
.
I
still
do
n't
know
how
he
does
it
.
He
despises
the
method

actors
.
The
stage
is
a

Nick

a
mindfuck

"
On
that
first
Broadway
night
I
had
stood
in
the
wings
where
he
was
absent-mindedly
fondling
the
breasts
of
his
frizzy-haired
admirer
,
and
to
me
he
had
looked
just
like
any
other
dirty
old
man
;
but
then
,
as
the
royal
fanfare
sounded
,
he
had
twitched
his
grey
gown
,
given
me
a
wink
,
and
walked
into
the
stage
's
glare
.
"
Attend
the
lords
of
France
and
Burgundy
,
Gloucester
.
"
He
had
spoken
Lear
's
opening
lines
and
I
had
felt
a
shiver
run
through
the
theatre
's
great
darkness
,
because
the
voice
was
there
,
and
the
power
of
it
,
and
he
was
suddenly
not
a
dirty
old
man
at
all
,
but
a
great
,
kind
,
foolish
and
painfully
honest
King
.
The
performance
was
a
triumph
.
Later
that
night
,
drinking
champagne
at
the
first
night
party
,
he
gave
me
his
usual
disclaimers
;
how
it
was
all
an
illusion
,
everything
was
an
illusion
,
all
life
was
an
illusion
,
and
how
he
,
Sir
Tom
,
was
the
master
of
illusion
,
but
how
his
dear
children
were
real
because
they
alone
could
not
be
spawned
from
the
imagination
.

He
looked
across
the
room
to
where
a
famous
actress
held
scornful
court
.
"
I
screwed
her
in
a
hot-air
balloon

Over
California
.
Her
husband
chased
us
in
a
jeep
,
and
the
oscillations
of
the
basket
told
him
what
I
was
doing
to
his
wife
,
and
the
poor
man
was
jealous
.
"
My
father
had
begun
to
giggle
.
"
Do
you
know
what
she
told
me

She
said

could
feel

shard
of
genius
enter
her
soul
with
my
seed
!
Oh
,
Nick
!
How
generous
I
have
been
with
my
genius
.
Her
silly
husband
shot
himself
,
which
was
hardly
surprising
because
she
was
a
rotten
lay
.
"
He
talked
me
into
staying
two
more
days
,
and
thus
three
days
passed
before
I
discovered
that
Masquerade
was
missing
.
It
was
another
seven
days
before
she
was
found
grinding
her
starboard
side
to
shreds
on
a
coral
reef
north
of
Straker
's
Cay
in
the
Far-Out
Islands
.
Bonefish
Straker
reckoned
that
some
Bahamian
kids
must
have
stolen
the
boat
as
a
means
of
getting
home
,
but
we
would
never
know
who
had
wrecked
her
,
only
that
they
had
removed
a
dinghy
load
of
gear
including
her
chronometer
,
sextant
,
VHF
,
barometer
,
spare
sails
,
lines
,
fenders
,
and
even
the
mattress
off
the
starboard
quarter-berth
.
They
had
stolen
my
good
oilskins
,
but
the
thieves
had
never
found
my
small
stash
of
money
which
had
been
hidden
in
a
redundant
sea-cock
,
nor
had
they
found
the
old
Webley.455
revolver
that
I
had
hidden
deep
in
Masquerade
's
bilges
.
The
gun
itself
had
been
a
prop
in
a
film
version
of
Journey
's
End
in
which
my
father
had
starred
,
and
when
the
filming
was
over
he
had
"
forgotten
"
to
return
the
pistol
which
was
still
in
good
working
order
.
I
had
fewer
than
a
hundred
rounds
for
the
gun
which
I
kept
solely
as
a
deterrent
for
those
remote
places
where
cruising
yachtsmen
are
seen
as
plump
victims
,
ripe
for
pillaging
,
and
the
Webley
offered
me
good
protection
for
,
though
the
gun
was
over
seventy
years
old
,
it
was
massively
built
and
frighteningly
powerful
.
Bonefish
Straker
had
rescued
Masquerade
,
propping
her
up
in
his
own
backyard
and
refusing
to
take
any
money
from
me
as
a
salvage
fee
.
Bonefish
Straker
was
Thessalonians
,
father
,
and
also
father
to
two
dozen
other
children
,
most
of
them
orphans
who
had
been
unofficially
adopted
by
Bonefish
and
his
wife
,
Sarah
.
Bonefish
's
real
name
was
Hector
,
but
he
had
earned
his
nickname
because
of
his
uncanny
ability
to
find
the
elusive
fish
.
He
was
reckoned
one
of
the
islands
'
best
fishing
guides
,
a
man
who
could
name
his
own
price
to
the
rich
northerners
who
came
to
the
blue
waters
to
kill
gamefish
,
but
Bonefish
believed
that
his
family
might
stray
from
the
path
of
righteousness
if
he
spent
too
much
time
away
from
home
so
he
restricted
his
guide
work
to
just
a
few
weeks
of
the
year
.
The
rest
of
the
time
he
caught
snapper
or
conch
or
lobster
,
and
brooded
over
the
souls
of
his
ramshackle
family
;
each
of
whom
was
named
for
a
different
book
in
the
Bible
.
He
had
started
at
the
back
of
the
good
book
and
was
perversely
working
his
way
towards
Genesis
,
which
meant
that
his
eldest
daughter
was
called
Revelation
Straker
;
a
young
woman
as
pretty
as
her
name
,
and
as
happy
as
all
the
other
children
who
grew
up
under
Bonefish
's
skinny
care
.
Bonefish
,
in
brief
,
was
a
very
good
man
who
had
never
heard
of
Sir
Thomas
Breakspear
,
and
I
was
a
very
lucky
man
for
the
fortunate
accident
of
having
met
Bonefish
.
He
watched
in
anxious
silence
as
I
ran
a
hand
over
the
repairs
he
had
begun
on
Masquerade
.
A
Danish
yawl
had
been
wrecked
on
the
far
side
of
the
island
two
years
before
and
Bonefish
had
rescued
some
of
her
oak
timbers
which
he
had
scarfed
in
to
Masquerade
's
broken
hull
.
Only
one
rib
had
needed
replacing
and
Bonefish
apologised
that
he
had
fashioned
that
new
one
from
a
piece
of
his
own
Madeira
wood
.
"
It
's
a
wonderful
job

I
said
respectfully

It
was

Bonefish
went
on
as
though
I
had
not
spoken
.
He
called
all
white
men
"
sir
"
.
To
him
we
were
still
the
missionaries
who
had
brought
God
to
his
soul
and
law
to
his
land
.
I
had
tried
to
tell
him
that
the
world
had
changed
drastically
,
but
Bonefish
did
not
want
to
believe
in
change
.
He
was
descended
from
slaves
who
had
accompanied
their
master
,
one
Rafe
Straker
,
from
Long
Island
in
1783
.
Rafe
Straker
,
like
many
of
the
original
white
settlers
of
the
Bahamas
,
had
been
an
American
loyalist
who
could
not
stomach
life
under
George
Washington
.
The
white
Straker
family
had
long
disappeared
,
their
genes
and
blood
melded
into
the
vigorous
bodies
of
their
freed
slaves
,
and
only
the
Straker
name
lived
on
to
be
given
new
dignity
by
Bonefish
and
his
family
.
"
I
do
n't
know

vere
ve

"
Bonefish
drew
his
hand
over
the
abraded
edges
of
the
copper
sheathing
left
on
Masquerade
's
hull
.
"
I
'll

brown
paper

"
The
copper
was
bedded
on
to
the
wood
with
tarred
brown
paper
.
Bonefish
gave
me
a
swift
silent
grin
.
"
I
think
ve
can
manage
tar
and
paper
,
sir
.
"
Thessy
,
squatting
nearby
as
he
waited
for
his
father
's
permission
to
join
the
conversation
,
looked
up
as
a
twin-engined
plane
howled
low
overhead
.
The
plane
's
registration
number
was
so
faded
as
to
be
illegible
,
but
I
recognised
the
machine
anyway
.
It
belonged
to
the
Maggot
,
whose
real
name
was
John
Maggovertski
.
The
Maggot
was
an
expatriate
American
who
ran
a
slew
of
businesses
from
his
Grand
Bahama
home
.
All
of
the
Maggot
's
businesses
were
perpetually
on
the
fringe
of
bankruptcy
.
One
of
his
shakier
concerns
was
an
air-taxi
service
with
which
he
scared
the
wits
out
of
travellers
too
innocent
to
know
better
than
to
fly
with
him
.
The
shriek
of
the
plane
's
engines
drowned
our
voices
,
so
Bonefish
and
I
just
watched
as
the
plane
sank
towards
Straker
Cay
's
small
airstrip
.
Once
the
machine
had
disappeared
behind
the
trees
Bonefish
shook
his
head
sadly
.
To
him
all
aircraft
were
harbingers
of
dreadful
change
,
mere
noisy
messengers
of
a
Godless
world
;
which
,
I
realised
,
was
a
pretty
accurate
description
of
the
Maggot
himself
.
I
assumed
the
Maggot
was
delivering
or
picking
up
a
customer
,
but
it
was
none
of
my
business
,
so
I
stripped
down
to
my
shorts
and
began
work
as
Thessy
,
his
brother
Philemon
and
their
father
took
a
battered
wooden
skiff
across
the
lagoon
.
Two
brown
pelicans
flapped
past
as
I
began
shaping
the
broken
ends
of
Masquerade
's
shattered
planking
.
The
sun
was
warm
on
my
back
,
but
the
south-easterly
wind
took
the
edge
off
the
stifling
heat
.
A
gaggle
of
Bonefish
's
children
were
in
constant
,
but
changing
,
attendance
,
sometimes
helping
me
,
but
more
often
chasing
each
other
in
a
complicated
game
of
tag
up
and
over
Masquerade
's
hull
.
Revelation
came
and
sat
in
the
shade
of
Masquerade
's
bows
where
she
plucked
two
chickens
that
I
suspected
had
been
killed
in
honour
of
my
return
to
the
island
.
The
chickens
'
surviving
relatives
clucked
and
scratched
in
the
dirt
,
oblivious
to
the
drifting
feathers
.
Revelation
and
I
chatted
idly
,
content
to
let
the
minutes
drift
pass
like
warm
thistledown
.
"
Thessy
says
he
's
been
offered
a
lot
of
money
for
a
charter

Revelation
eventually
challenged
me
.
"
That
's
true

"
"
But

vo
n't

"
I

She
gave

gallantry
the
scorn
it
deserved
.
"
Father

n't
really
vant
him

"
"
So
it
does
n't
matter

I

"
I
said
with
some
relief
,
for
I
had
been
feeling
somewhat
guilty
at
risking
Thessy
's
chances
of
making
some
money
.
"
But
if
you
go
on
this
charter
,
Father
will
let
Thessy
go
.
"
Revelation
went
sweetly
on
,
thus
impaling
me
on
the
hook
of
my
own
guilt
once
more
.
It
was
I
who
had
introduced
Thessy
to
McIllvanney
and
who
had
secured
him
the
job
with
Cutwater
,
but
Bonefish
had
only
allowed
his
son
into
the
wide
wicked
world
because
of
his
trust
in
me
.
I
was
not
certain
that
the
trust
was
deserved
,
but
Bonefish
was
convinced
I
was
protecting
his
son
from
iniquity
,
and
no
assertion
to
the
contrary
would
convince
him
otherwise
.
"
And
if
Thessy
vent
,
"
Revelation
continued
,
"
then
the
money
vould
be
good
,
because
the
outboard
is
broken
and
Father
ca
n't
mend
it
and
there
's
no
money
for
another
.
"
She
sighed
,
then
twisted
on
her
stool
to
gaze
in
astonishment
because
a
car
was
thumping
and
crashing
its
way
along
the
dirt
road
that
led
from
the
island
's
one
village
to
Bonefish
's
sprawl
of
shacks
.
It
was
clear
from
Revelation
's
expression
that
cars
were
as
uncommon
at
this
end
of
the
island
as
polar
bears
;
indeed
,
the
sight
of
one
was
so
surprising
that
she
picked
up
her
skirts
and
,
with
the
younger
children
around
her
,
fled
towards
the
safety
of
her
mother
's
kitchen
.
The
car
,
an
ancient
Pontiac
taxi
that
was
painted
six
shades
of
yellow
and
purple
,
stopped
outside
the
twin
piles
of
broken
coral
that
were
Bonefish
's
proud
gateposts
.
There
was
a
pause
,
then
the
back
door
of
the
cab
opened
,
and
a
very
tall
white
man
climbed
out
into
the
sun
.
He
was
dressed
in
checked
golfing
trousers
,
cowboy
boots
and
a
cowboy
hat
.
He
blinked
uncertainly
at
the
landscape
.
He
looked
lost
and
nervous
,
as
though
he
was
unsure
of
where
he
was
or
why
he
had
bothered
to
come
.
Then
he
saw
me
,
waved
,
and
began
walking
slowly
towards
me
.
I
did
not
respond
,
for
I
was
feeling
nothing
but
astonishment
.
I
could
not
even
speak
.
I
was
struck
dumb
because
George
Crowninshield
,
senator
and
possibly
a
future
President
of
the
United
States
,
had
come
alone
to
Straker
's
Cay
.
"
Hello
,
Nick
.
"
He
held
out
a
hand
and
gave
me
a
smile
.
"
Oh
,
bloody
hell
,
"
I
found
my
voice
.
Then
shook
his
hand
.
One
night
during
our
charter
,
when
we
had
been
sipping
whisky
under
the
stars
,
Senator
Crowninshield
had
told
me
that
no
fat
man
could
ever
again
become
President
of
the
United
States
.
"
William
Taft
will
be
the
last
really
fat
President
,
"
he
had
told
me
.
"
Was
he
very
fat
?
"
"
Big
as
a
house
,
Nick
.
"
The
senator
had
frowned
,
then
opined
that
it
was
not
just
the
fat
who
were
for
ever
barred
from
the
Oval
Office
,
but
even
the
ugly
.
America
,
Crowninshield
had
said
with
a
note
of
amusement
in
his
voice
,
was
doomed
for
ever
to
have
toothsome
Presidents
,
and
all
because
television
now
ruled
politics
.
He
had
sounded
amused
,
but
then
he
had
turned
to
me
and
pointed
to
his
chin
.
"
See
the
scar
?
"
There
had
been
the
faintest
mark
against
his
tanned
skin
,
so
I
had
nodded
.
"
I
had
a
dimple
there
,
"
the
Senator
had
confessed
with
his
engaging
frankness
,
"
which
my
advisers
determined
made
me
look
too
baby-faced
,
and
so
we
had
it
removed
.
"
He
had
laughed
,
simultaneously
mocking
the
stupidity
of
government
by
cosmetics
and
confessing
that
he
was
also
a
part
of
it
,
just
as
he
was
part
of
government
by
voice
coach
and
acting
coach
.
Not
that
the
senator
needed
a
beautician
's
help
if
he
was
to
become
President
,
for
George
Crowninshield
was
a
good-looking
man
with
a
strong-boned
face
and
a
head
of
thick
black
hair
.
He
had
to
be
fifty
,
but
he
did
not
look
a
day
over
thirty-five
,
an
illusion
helped
by
his
lopsided
boyish
grin
that
was
so
very
full
of
charm
.
It
was
the
candid
charm
that
was
his
greatest
public
asset
.
He
was
popularly
supposed
to
be
a
man
who
not
only
told
the
truth
,
but
who
could
not
tell
a
lie
,
and
the
senator
's
aides
and
publicists
were
not
unhappy
to
promulgate
that
echo
of
a
previous
President
's
virtues
.
Not
everyone
was
so
impressed
by
Senator
Crowninshield
.
Ellen
said
he
was
a
political
lightweight
whose
stagecraft
was
better
than
his
statecraft
.
The
usual
jibe
was
that
Crowninshield
was
a
politician
without
a
cause
,
or
rather
that
he
would
support
any
cause
so
long
as
it
was
fashionable
,
but
his
critics
also
attacked
Crowninshield
for
being
wealthy
,
claiming
that
his
eminence
was
solely
due
to
the
vast
amounts
of
money
that
he
spent
on
his
campaigns
.
One
night
,
long
after
the
senator
had
chartered
Wavebreaker
,
I
had
defended
him
to
Ellen
,
saying
that
it
was
not
Crowninshield
's
fault
that
he
had
been
born
to
wealthy
parents
,
and
that
he
had
used
his
wealth
well
.
"
He
's
an
honest
man
,
"
I
had
said
trenchantly
,
"
and
there
are
n't
too
many
of
those
in
politics
.
"
Ellen
had
given
me
one
of
her
pitying
looks
.
"

had
not

her
then

I
did
not
believe
her
now

I
believed
the
senator
was
a
thoughtful
man
whose
wealth
had
elevated
him
above
the
need
to
make
compromises
with
his
convictions

He
was
also
a
man
who
seemed
mighty
pleased
to
see
me
again

He
lightly
punched
my
shoulder

The
senator
represented
a
beef-rearing
state
and
never
forgot
to
extol
the
benefits
of
a
plateful
of
bleeding
home-grown
American
steak
,
while
in
private
,
as
I
had
learned
when
he

his
wife
had

George
Crowninshield
rarely
touched
red
meat

The
yellow
and
purple
taxi
was
waiting

The
taxi

was
squatting
by
one
of
Bonefish
's
gateposts
where
he
surreptitiously
smoked
a
cigarette
.
When

The
Maggot
had
played
American
football
until
he
had
come
off
his
Harley-Davidson
at
eighty
miles
an
hour
and
permanently
damaged
his
left
knee

Sometimes
,
when
drunk
,
he
would
regale
me
with
stories
of
his
footballing
prowess
,
but
such
stories
went
past
me
like
galley
smoke
because
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
enquire

nor
indeed
to
care

about
the
differences
between
a
Tight

a
flea-flicker

When
the
Maggot
became
too
boring
about
football
I
told
him
cricketing
stories

he
shut
up

liked
each
other

He
had
evidently
forgiven
my
mimicry
.
He
now
took
a
pair
of
sunglasses
from
his
shirt
pocket
and
pointed
them
at
me
.
When
I
made
no
response
he
turned
and
gazed
at
the
far
line
of
coral
reef
that
was
marked
by
a
fret
of
white
breaking
water
.
I
could
see
Bonefish
and
his
sons
working
the
lateen-sail
of
their
skiff
way
beyond
the
reef
,
perhaps
looking
for
turtles
which
they
could
sell
to
the
men
who
exported
the
rich
flesh
to
the
Japanese
.
The
sun
was
flat
and
hard
and
brilliant
on
the
nearer
water
,
forcing
Crowninshield
to
turn
back
to
me
.
"
I
need
your
help
,
Nick
,
because
my
only
son
is
dying
and
my
only
daughter
is
following
his
example
,
and
I
need
a
strong
man
who
will
save
them

He
said
the
words
in
the
same
light
tone
of
voice
he
had
used
when
speaking
of
my
boat
,
and
somehow
the
discordant
contrast
between
the
tone
and
the
message
threw
me
.
I
was
not
certain
I
had
heard
aright
,
then
knew
I
had
,
and
I
suddenly
felt
a
very
British
rush
of
embarrassment
because
of
the
senator
's
frankness
.
"
Your
son
is
dying
?
"
I
responded
inadequately
.
"
Rickie
is
a
drug
addict
,
"
he
explained
gently
.
I
said
nothing
for
a
few
seconds
.
"
Oh
,
shit
,
"
I
then
said
,
because
that
was
how
I
felt
and
because
I
suddenly
knew
that
the
next
few
minutes
were
going
to
be
extraordinarily
difficult
.
"
Specifically
Rickie
is
addicted
to
cocaine
,
"
the
senator
continued
,
"
but
I
ca
n't
say
he
's
particular
in
his
tastes

He
uses
crack
and
cocaine
and
amphetamines
,
then
more
crack
and
more
cocaine
and
perhaps
even
a
speedball
to
round
things
off
.
You
know
what
a
speedball
is
,
Nick

-
the
senator
's
voice
was
very
bitter

"
and
all
of
that
garbage
is
washed
down
with
alcohol
and
pickled
in
nicotine

My
son
is
a
dying
junkie
,

he
does
n't
want
to
die
alone

he
's
encouraging
Robin-Anne
to
keep
him
company

now
she
's
become
addicted
to
cocaine

it
wo
n't
be
very
long
before
she
's
smoking
crack

trying
speedballs

"
The
senator
spoke
with
a
sudden
and
incredible
venom
,
and
I
realised
it
was
only
that
angry
force
that
was
keeping
him
from
weeping
for
his
two
children
.
"
It
seems
,
"
he
went
on
in
a
calmer
voice
,
"
that
Rickie
and
Robin-Anne
are
among
the
sizeable
minority
of
the
population
that
is
peculiarly
prone
to
severe
addiction
.
"
I
wondered
why
McIllvanney
had
not
told
me
that
Rickie
and
Robin-Anne
Crowninshield
were
drug
addicts
,
then
I
realised
that
McIllvanney
would
not
have
told
me
anything
that
might
have
risked
my
acceptance
of
the
charter
,
but
now
that
I
had
learned
that
the
twins
had
such
a
severe
drug
problem
I
was
even
less
keen
to
take
on
the
job
.
"
I
'm
no
expert
on
drugs
,
senator
,
"
I
said
.
"
There
must
be
hospitals
they
can
go
to
?
"
He
nodded
.
"
Of
course
there
are
such
hospitals
,
and
the
twins
are
under
the
supervision
of
a
clinic
right
now
,
but
I
believe
they
need
extraordinary
help
.
"
He
paused
,
and
gave
me
a
flicker
of
his
famous
smile
.
"

an
extraordinary

I

I

flatly

Crowninshield
smiled

"

I
said
with
dismissive
untruth
.
"

Crowninshield
went
on
.
"
I
remember
those
nights
we
shared
our
thoughts
on
that
subject
,
Nick
,
and
I
think
my
son
kind
of
needs
the
understanding
you
can
give

"
I
shied
away
from
the
very
American-sounding
compliment
.
"

"

I
protested
.
"
Yes
you
are
,
"
Crowninshield
insisted
.
"
You
're
an
expert
sailor
,
and
that
's
good
because
it
means
you
can
take
the
twins
to
sea
and
keep
them
there
until
they
're
damn
well
cured

I
do
n't
care
what
hell
they
go
through
.
I
do
n't
care

they
have
to
be
strapped
to
the
mast
.
I
do
n't
care
if
they
're
hallucinating
purple
snakes
and
blue
baboons
,
because
the
whole
point
of
putting
them
on
a
boat
is
that
they
ca
n't
get
off
and
swim
home
,
and
they
ca
n't
get
drugs
on
board
,
and
they
ca
n't
bribe
you
to
take
them
to
land
,
and
that
means
they
'll
have
no
damned
choice
but
to
get
cured
.
"
I
said
nothing
.
I
was
thinking
of
all
the
work
I
needed
to
do
on
Masquerade
;
all
the
painstaking
hours
of
sawing
and
planing
and
caulking
and
rigging
.
Crowninshield
stared
at
me
through
his
obscuring
lenses
.
"
Nick
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
"
my
son
is
going
to
die
within
a
year
if
I
do
n't
do
something
very
drastic
.
He
's
already
lost
the
sight
of
his
left
eye
because
cocaine
starved
the
retina
of
blood
,
and
he
's
damn
lucky
not
to
be
totally
blind
,
or
even
dead
,
because
the
next
time
it
could
constrict
the
arteries
of
his
heart
or
block
the
blood
from
reaching
his
brain
.
Or
next
time
it
could
be
Robin-Anne
.
So
I
have
to
do
something
because
I
ca
n't
just
stand
idle
and
let
my
kids
die
.
"
The
pain
in
the
senator
's
voice
was
awful
,
but
I
still
did
not
want
to
become
involved
.
I
began
walking
along
the
track
leading
behind
the
beach
towards
the
village
,
which
was
marked
by
the
red
tin
roof
of
a
tiny
church
showing
above
the
casuarinas
and
palm
trees
.
The
senator
fell
into
step
beside
me
while
some
of
Bonefish
's
smaller
children
followed
at
a
safe
distance
.
We
stopped
close
to
a
small
graveyard
where
a
tribe
of
wild
goats
stared
suspiciously
at
us
from
between
the
mounds
of
earth
and
bleak
wooden
crosses
.
The
senator
was
looking
at
the
sun-reflecting
sea
.
"
The
truth
is
,
Nick
,
I
messed
up
my
kids
,
and
that
hurts
.
It
was
n't
lack
of
love
.
Hell
,
I
had
a
bumper
sticker
saying
"
Have
You
Hugged
Your
Kids
Today
?
"
and
,
sure
,
I
hugged
them
every
day
I
could
,
but
nowadays
I
sometimes
wonder
just
what
in
hell
is
going
on
inside
their
heads
.
Especially
Rickie
.
It
's
easier
to
extract
sense
out
of
a
fruitfly
than
to
get
a
civil
word
out
of
Rickie
.
They
threw
him
out
of
college
because
of
cocaine
,
and
he
was
damn
lucky
that
they
did
n't
call
the
police
,
but
all
he
'd
say
to
me
was
to
stay
cool
!
To
stay
cool
,
for
Christ
's
sake
!
Your
only
son
is
a
college
drop-out
,
and
bleeding
from
the
nose
because
his
blood
vessels
are
popping
from
all
the
cocaine
in
his
system
,
and
he
tells
you
to
keep
your
cool
!
"
I
did
n't
know
what
to
say
,
so
said
nothing
.
A
tiny
lizard
watched
me
with
unblinking
eyes
from
a
rock
beside
the
lagoon
,
while
above
the
trees
the
red
tin
church
roof
shimmered
bright
in
the
sultry
heat
.
"
Did
you
ever
take
drugs
?
"
the
senator
asked
me
after
a
long
silence
.
"
No
.
"
My
father
had
often
urged
me
to
try
some
of
his
marijuana
,
but
I
had
never
accepted
,
just
as
I
had
refused
even
to
look
at
the
cocaine
that
he
kept
in
his
dressing
room
.
"
Lucky
you
,

the
senator
said
ruefully
.
"
You
're
a
happy
man

n't
you
,
Nick

That
's
why
I
want
you
to
take
the
twins
to
sea
.
I
want
some
of
your
certainty
and
happiness
to
rub
off
on
my
kid
?
"
I
shrugged
that
embarrassing
wish
away
.
Ellen
had
once
assured
me
that
I
was
only
happy
because
I
did
not
think
too
deeply
,
and
probably
she
was
right
,
but
it
is
still
that
shallow
contentment
which
makes
people
bring
me
their
troubles
just
as
the
senator
was
now
bringing
me
his
two
children
.
"
What
I
do
n't
understand
,
"
I
said
harshly
,
and
in
an
attempt
to
steer
the
conversation
away
from
compliments
,
"
is
why
you
give
the
twins
enough
money
to
buy
themselves
drugs
in
the
first
place
.
"
What
I
really
could
not
understand
was
why
the
senator
did
not
beat
ten
kinds
of
nonsense
out
of
a
son
who
told
him
to
cool
it
,
but
telling
middle-class
Americans
to
thump
their
kids
is
like
asking
them
to
burn
their
flag
,
so
I
did
not
waste
my
time
.
"
They
've
got
their
own
money

the
senator
answered
,
"

to
them

grandmother

twins
are
only
entitled
to
the
income

I
control
the

that
changes

their
birthday
next
month
.
"
"

The
senator
nodded
.
He
sensed
my
curiosity
about
how
much
the
twins
were
worth
,
and
for
a
few
seconds
reticence
and
candour
fought
across
his
face
,
but
then
he
shrugged
.
"

The

was
again
not
looking
at
me

at
the

was
immensely
sad

felt
his
sadness

hopelessness

still
reluctant
to
embroil
myself

There
had
to
be
agencies

were
competent
to
deal
with
drug
abuse

the
best
I
could

an
enthusiastic
amateur

was
rarely
good
enough

wanted
the

to
talk

dreamed
up
a
strategy

turn
down
his
request

a

the
good
time

he

down

Our

the

altered
the
terms

Galahad
and
I
never
could
resist
the
lure
of
the
dragon
's
breath
even
if
it
did
mean
charging
into
idiocy
like
a
fool
.
So
I
reached
for
the
senator
's
hand
,
and
thereby
couched
my
lance
to
face
the
dragon
's
fire
.
I
should
have
thought
more
deeply
before
I
agreed
,
but
that
's
not
how
fools
charge
in
.
I
did
n't
think
before
I
went
into
the
recruiting
office
and
became
a
marine
,
and
I
did
n't
think
now
.
Instead
I
consoled
myself
that
Ellen
would
be
pleased
,
and
a
pleased
Ellen
might
become
my
shipmate
all
the
way
around
the
world
,
so
really
,
I
told
myself
,
I
was
not
doing
this
for
the
senator
's
happiness
,
and
not
even
for
the
twins
,
but
for
my
own
,
and
so
I
shook
the
senator
's
hand
.
The
Maggot
was
waiting
at
the
airstrip
.
He
gave
me
a
welcoming
grin
and
an
ironic
bow
to
acknowledge
the
exalted
company
I
was
keeping
,
then
he
ushered
the
senator
on
to
the
starboard
wing
and
so
into
the
aeroplane
.
It
always
seemed
miraculous
that
the
Maggot
could
fit
himself
into
a
small
aircraft
,
for
John
Maggovertski
was
a
huge
man
:
six
foot
five
and
well
over
two
hundred
pounds
,
and
none
of
those
pounds
was
fat
.
I
sometimes
tried
to
imagine
blocking
the
Maggot
during
a
game
of
American
football
and
simply
could
not
.
It
would
be
like
trying
to
stop
a
buffalo
,
because
he
was
nothing
but
muscle
,
weight
and
bone
.
For
exterior
decoration
he
had
a
thick
black
beard
,
dark
eyes
,
a
shock
of
tousled
hair
,
and
weight-lifter
's
arms
that
were
tattooed
with
snakes
,
naked
ladies
and
the
twin
flags
of
the
USA
and
the
Maggot
's
home
state
of
Arkansas
.
He
put
the
senator
into
one
of
the
back
seats
,
first
shoving
aside
a
tangle
of
camera
equipment
.
Another
of
John
Maggovertski
's
failing
businesses
was
taking
aerial
photographs
of
rich
folk
's
houses
.
He
also
refilled
air-bottles
for
scuba
divers
,
ran
sports-fishing
excursions
and
,
despite
his
slow
left
knee
,
was
a
good
enough
tennis
player
to
have
been
hired
as
a
coach
at
some
of
the
Lucaya
hotels
,
though
the
Maggot
's
career
as
a
tennis
coach
had
been
somewhat
jeopardised
by
his
insistence
on
helping
only
the
prettier
guests
to
improve
their
game
.
He
sporadically
published
a
newsletter
about
rare
firearms
,
collected
guns
himself
,
and
was
the
proud
owner
of
a
decrepit
fishing
boat
that
was
called
Bronco-Buster
in
honour
of
the
Giants
'
Superbowl
victory
,
though
the
Maggot
himself
never
referred
to
the
beaten
team
as
the
Denver
Broncos
,
but
always
and
ever
as
the
Denver
Fairies
.
The
Maggot
referred
to
himself
as
a
"
good
old
country
boy
"
which
description
provoked
Ellen
,
who
could
not
stand
the
sight
of
him
,
to
comment
that
John
Maggovertski
was
to
country
what
the
serpent
was
to
Eden
.
The
Maggot
,
Ellen
insisted
,
was
an
untoilet-trained
redneck
jerk
whose
only
expertise
was
as
a
player
of
the
most
brutal
and
mindless
sport
to
be
devised
since
the
lions
took
on
the
Christians
.
The
Maggot
,
faced
with
these
scathing
judgments
,
countered
by
asserting
that
Ellen
's
education
had
ruined
what
might
otherwise
have
been
a
useful
bimbo
,
and
loudly
proclaimed
that
her
extreme
aversion
to
himself
was
positive
psychological
proof
that
she
was
secretly
enamoured
of
him
.
On
the
whole
I
found
it
less
tiring
to
keep
the
two
of
them
apart
.
The
Maggot
now
ordered
me
into
the
right-hand
pilot
's
seat
and
told
me
to
keep
my
thieving
hands
off
his
knobs
.
As
he
fired
up
the
twin
engines
I
wondered
just
what
instruments
had
once
occupied
the
vacant
holes
in
the
dashboard
,
from
which
empty
holes
there
now
trailed
forlorn
scraps
of
wiring
.
It
was
best
not
to
wonder
,
for
I
faced
a
long
journey
in
what
remained
of
the
Maggot
's
plane
.
We
were
flying
first
to
Nassau
where
the
senator
was
to
be
guest
of
honour
at
an
American
Embassy
reception
for
senior
officers
of
the
naval
units
taking
part
in
Exercise
Stingray
,
and
after
Nassau
the
Maggot
and
I
would
fly
on
to
Grand
Bahama
where
he
lived
and
where
Wavebreaker
was
docked
.
"
Are
you
sure
you
do
n't
want
us
boys
to
keep
you
company
at
the
reception
,
senator
?
"
John
asked
.
"
I
'd
be
surely
delighted
to
have
your
company
.
"
The
senator
,
ever
affable
,
seemed
unworried
at
the
thought
of
taking
the
Maggot
into
polite
society
.
"
Do
I
have
to
wear
a
tie
?
"
"
I
guess
so
.
I
'll
be
wearing
one
.
"
"
Reckon
I
'll
leave
the
embassy
girls
to
you
then
,
senator
,
"
the
Maggot
had
to
shout
over
the
sound
of
the
engines
,
"
and
me
and
Nick
will
just
have
to
play
with
each
other
on
account
of
forgetting
to
bring
our
ties
.
"
He
laughed
,
then
frowned
at
the
aircraft
's
controls
as
if
he
was
not
entirely
certain
what
most
of
them
did
.
One
reason
why
John
's
air-taxi
service
was
less
than
successful
was
his
habit
of
pretending
not
to
know
how
to
fly
the
plane
or
,
worse
,
pretending
to
have
forgotten
how
to
land
it
once
he
had
succeeded
in
becoming
airborne
.
The
performances
made
his
customers
understandably
nervous
,
and
nervous
customers
do
not
pass
on
glowing
recommendations
to
their
friends
.
"
I
suppose
we
should
try
and
get
this
hot
heap
of
shit
off
the
ground
,
"
the
Maggot
growled
now
.
It
was
indeed
as
hot
as
hell
inside
the
aircraft
.
We
taxied
away
from
the
palm-thatched
hut
that
was
proudly
styled
as
Straker
's
Cay
Airport
Terminal
Number
One
.
The
hut
was
home
to
some
lizards
and
to
the
island
's
one
taxi
driver
who
had
sequestered
it
as
his
office
and
gasoline
store
.
The
airstrip
itself
had
been
built
to
serve
a
golf
and
diving
resort
that
a
consortium
of
Dutch
and
American
businessmen
had
planned
to
build
on
Straker
's
Cay
,
but
the
money
had
run
out
before
the
hotel
or
marina
had
been
built
and
all
that
was
left
of
their
grandiose
plans
was
this
pinkish
runway
made
of
compacted
coral
and
a
few
abandoned
cement
mixers
which
rusted
forlornly
where
the
hotel
's
swimming
pool
was
to
have
been
built
.
The
Maggot
,
who
refused
to
wear
a
seat
belt
,
shoved
his
throttles
forward
,
and
I
felt
the
sweat
trickling
down
my
belly
as
the
brakes
were
released
and
the
small
plane
thundered
down
the
rough
surface
.
"
It
plays
hell
with
the
tyres
,
senator
!
"
The
Maggot
yelled
over
the
howling
engine
noise
.
"
What
does
?
"
The
senator
shouted
back
.
"
Runways
made
of
crushed
coral
!
As
likely
as
not
we
'll
blow
a
tyre
,
slew
off
,
and
become
three
small
puddles
of
melted
fat
in
a
blackened
and
twisted
plane
wreck
!
"
The
senator
blanched
and
leaned
back
.
I
had
heard
it
all
before
and
so
was
a
little
more
sanguine
.
The
Maggot
,
pleased
to
have
spoilt
someone
's
day
,
pulled
back
the
stick
and
we
liked
safely
off
the
runway
and
there
was
suddenly
a
wonderful
rush
of
cool
air
coming
from
an
overhead
vent
.
We
banked
over
Bonefish
's
house
and
I
waved
at
Thessy
who
was
standing
beside
Masquerade
.
Thessy
would
follow
on
the
weekend
ferry
,
arriving
at
Grand
Bahama
on
the
same
day
as
the
senator
's
twins
.
The
Maggot
's
Beechcraft
clawed
higher
,
its
progress
punctuated
by
the
alarm
sirens
that
the
Maggot
ignored
and
which
the
senator
had
learned
not
to
worry
about
.
Once
,
when
an
alarm
became
peculiarly
insistent
,
the
Maggot
thumped
the
instrument
panel
until
it
stopped
.
"
I
think
that
goddamn
racket
means
we
should
all
be
dead
,
"
he
announced
cheerfully
,
then
carried
on
with
an
involved
story
of
how
he
had
once
won
undying
glory
by
intercepting
a
pass
against
the
Philadelphia
Faggots
.
In
the
senator
the
Maggot
had
found
a
listener
who
was
only
too
eager
to
hear
his
tales
of
goal-line
stands
and
blocked
punts
,
concussed
running
backs
and
sacked
quarterbacks
.
The
one
subject
we
did
not
talk
about
was
why
the
senator
had
flown
to
Straker
's
Cay
to
meet
me
.
I
knew
the
Maggot
was
dying
to
hear
the
senator
's
business
,
but
even
the
Maggot
had
enough
delicacy
to
wait
until
we
had
safely
delivered
the
senator
to
Nassau
before
asking
.
But
once
Crowninshield
was
gone
,
and
when
we
had
refuelled
the
Beechcraft
and
put
a
crate
of
beer
on
to
one
of
her
back
seats
,
the
Maggot
demanded
to
know
everything
.
I
suspected
that
he
was
hoping
to
hear
that
the
senator
had
been
arranging
for
an
illicit
love
affair
on
board
Wavebreaker
.
We
had
embarked
two
such
affairs
in
the
last
year
;
the
most
memorable
being
an
English
lawyer
who
had
arrived
with
his
French
mistress
,
but
only
after
telling
his
wife
that
he
was
attending
a
legal
conference
in
Brussels
and
,
to
preserve
the
lie
,
he
had
been
forced
to
hide
every
inch
of
his
pallid
skin
in
case
a
sun-tan
betrayed
him
.
The
French
girl
,
to
Thessy
's
infinite
embarrassment
,
had
strolled
stark
naked
about
Wavebreaker
's
deck
while
the
lawyer
had
cowered
in
the
stateroom
cloaked
like
an
Ayatollah
with
impetigo
.
The
Maggot
,
disappointed
that
the
senator
's
business
offered
no
such
rich
pickings
of
gossip
,
scowled
at
me
.
"
You
mean
you
're
just
babysitting
two
rich
junkies
?
"
"
You
've
got
it
.
"
"
Shee-it
.
"
We
had
at
last
taken
off
from
Nassau
and
were
banking
north
to
where
three
American
warships
sliced
white
water
.
I
opened
us
each
a
beer
,
then
idly
unfolded
the
aviation
chart
that
the
Maggot
had
stuck
down
between
our
seats
.
It
looked
very
different
to
a
nautical
chart
and
made
little
sense
to
me
,
but
I
gradually
deciphered
some
of
the
meaning
from
its
weird
markings
.
"
You
ai
n't
going
to
have
fun
,
"
the
Maggot
said
suddenly
.
"
I
'm
sorry
?
"
"
You
ai
n't
going
to
have
fun
with
two
goddamn
cocaine
addicts
.
That
stuff
is
the
hardest
to
kick
.
"
"
So
the
senator
told
me
.
"
"
And
there
ai
n't
no
magic
pill
that
will
do
it
.
"
Maggovertski
sounded
unusually
sombre
.
He
lit
a
cigarette
.
"
I
hate
cocaine
,
"
he
said
finally
,
and
he
surprised
me
by
saying
it
for
the
Maggot
had
always
struck
me
as
one
of
life
's
rebels
.
If
he
discovered
a
new
rule
he
would
immediately
seek
a
way
of
breaking
it
,
and
I
had
assumed
that
he
would
have
some
sympathy
with
those
who
flouted
the
laws
against
drugs
,
yet
there
was
no
denying
the
genuine
anger
in
his
voice
when
he
talked
of
cocaine
.
He
must
have
sensed
my
puzzlement
,
for
he
offered
a
reluctant
explanation
.
"
I
knew
a
girl
who
got
hooked
on
cocaine
.
She
taught
in
a
health
club
;
aerobics
,
that
kind
of
thing
,
and
the
next
we
knew
she
was
wearing
hot
pants
on
a
street
corner
in
New
York
and
strutting
her
stuff
at
the
cars
.
Jesus
,
if
you
knew
how
hard
we
tried
to
get
her
off
that
damned
powder
.
"
"
Did
you
succeed
?
"
He
paused
,
and
finally
shook

Last
time
I
saw
her
she
was
doing
a
peep-show
in
Pittsburgh
.
Hell
,
Nick
,
I
tried
to
get
her
out
of
that
place
,
but
she
did
n't
care
.
All
she
wanted
to
do
was
shovel
that
crap
up
her
nose
,
and
if
that
's
how
someone
wants
to
pass
their
time
,
then
there
's
diddly-squat
you
can
do
to
stop
them
.
"
He
had
sounded
immensely
sad
as
he
spoke
,
and
I
wondered
if
the
girl
had
meant
more
to
him
than
being
merely
a
casual
friend
,
but
I
did
not
like
to
ask
and
Maggovertski
was
clearly
disinclined
to
explain
more
,
so
I
just
stared
down
at
the
aerial
chart
,
and
I
suddenly
noticed
,
in
an
otherwise
empty
space
beneath
an
intersection
of
two
air
corridors
,
the
tiny
island
of
Murder
Cay
.
The
chart
,
either
printed
before
the
government
's
name
change
or
else
blithely
ignoring
it
,
noted
the
existence
of
a
2500-foot
paved
airstrip
.
"

I
asked
Maggot
.
"

"
He
was
evidently
still
thinking
of
the
girl
,
for
the
obscenity
was
automatic
and
his
voice
was
clipped
and
distant
.
"
Have
you
ever
flown
into
Murder
Cay

"
I
asked
him
.
The
big
shaggy
head
turned
to
look
at
me
.
He
frowned
and
sucked
on
his
cigarette
and
I
somehow
got
the
impression
that
my
question
had
annoyed
him
,
but
when
he
answered
his
voice
was
mild
enough
.
"
It
's
a
snakepit

Nick
.
Leave
it
alone

"
"
So

I
insisted

He
paused
to
pull
on
his
beer
bottle
which
,
emptied
,
he
tossed
out
through
the
tiny
triangular
window
at
his
left
elbow
.
"
I
ran
a
couple
of
passengers
there
before
the
dickheads
bought
the
island
.
It
was
a
real
nice
place
two
years
ago
;
nothing
but
luxury
houses
for
the
super-rich
,
but
then
the
snakes
bought
it
and
they
've
painted
a
big
yellow
cross
on
their
runway
.
You
know
what
a
big
yellow
cross
on
a
runway
means
?
It
means
keep
away

"
"
So

The

assumed

had
already

I
looked
down
at
the
chart
and
saw
that
the
island
was
not
so
very
far
off
our
course
,
and
I
knew
that
the
Beechcraft
was
brim-full
with
fuel
.
"

laughed

I
had
reckoned
that
an
accusation

fear
would
sting
the
Maggot
,
and
even
before
he
interrupted
me
he
had
banked
the
plane
westwards
.
He
snatched
the
chart
off
my
lap
and
worked
out
a
crude
course
for
the
remote
island
.
"
So

he
grumbled
.
I
told
him
about
Hirondelle
and
how
Deacon
Billingsley
had
lied
about
the
yacht
's
fate
,
and
I
confessed
that
though
there
was
nothing
I
could
do
about
a
corrupt
policeman

nor
about
what
I
strongly
suspected
had
been
the
murder
of
a

the
important

growled
the
verdict
.
"

the
Maggot
said
gloomily
.
"
The
dickheads

that
the
best
way
of
keeping
the
Americans
off
their
backs
is
by
buying
themselves
a
slice
of
the
local
law
.
"
His
disgruntled
voice
made
it
seem
as
though
the
precautions
of
the
drug
smugglers
formed
a
personal
affront
to
his
patriotism
.
Yet
if
anyone
's
patriotism
should
have
been
affronted
by
what
happened
in
the
islands
,
it
was
the
Bahamians
,
for
they
were
forced
to
endure
the
indignity
of
having
another
nation
's
law-enforcement
agencies
operating
in
their
waters
.
The
islands
had
always
been
a
smugglers
'
paradise
,
and
had
proved
a
perfect
place
to
stockpile
cocaine
before
running
it
across
the
narrow
Straits
of
Florida
to
the
waiting
American
markets
.
The
American
government
had
pressed
the
Bahamians
to
clean
out
the
drug
lords
,
but
instead
the
trade
had
flourished
until
the
Americans
finally
insisted
that
their
own
coastguard
be
allowed
to
patrol
Bahamian
waters
.
A
scintilla
of
Bahamian
pride
was
preserved
by
the
presence
of
a
native
officer
on
every
American
boat
or
helicopter
,
but
no
one
really
believed
the
polite
fiction
that
the
local
officer
was
thus
in
command
.
"
But
we
ai
n't

command

the
Maggot
said
sourly
.

a
foot

you
can

your
pretty
ass

your
policeman
friend

making
sure

never
given

it
is

was
so
incongruous

bitter
ruefulness

paused

light
another

Far
ahead

blurred

the
heat
haze
,
there
was
a
bright
green
dot
of
an
island
ringed
by
coral-fretted
water
.
No
other
land
was
visible
.
The
Maggot
turned
in
his
seat
and
rummaged
in
his
camera
bag
until
he
found
a
battered
Nikon
and
a
roll
of
black
and
white
film
.
"
Take
some

You
never

some

Murder
Cay
one
day
.
"
By
the
time
I
had
loaded
the
camera
we
were
already
close
to
the
reefs
that
formed
the
Devil
's
Necklace
.
The
shadow
of
our
plane
skipped
across
the
bright
sea
,
then
flickered
over
the
outer
coral
.
We
were
approaching
the
island
from
the
south-east
,
coming
with
the
wind
at
a
height
of
six
thousand
feet
.
The
island
was
shaped
rather
like
an
anchor
.
The
airstrip
,
with
its
unfriendly
yellow
cross
that
warned
strange
aircraft
from
landing
,
had
been
built
across
the
curved
flukes
of
the
anchor
,
which
otherwise
seemed
to
be
covered
in
low
scrub
,
slash
pine
and
sea-grape
.
The
surprisingly
big
houses
were
all
built
on
the
western
side
of
the
north-south
shank
of
the
anchor
that
was
thick
with
palm
trees
and
vivid
with
bright
blue
swimming
pools
.
The
rest
of
the
shank
was
a
long
narrow
golf
course
,
punctuated
with
sand
traps
.
I
twisted
in
the
seat
to
see
that
there
were
a
dozen
or
so
boats
moored
in
the
protected
crook
of
the
easternmost
anchor
fluke
.
The
Maggot
dipped
the
starboard
wing
to
let
me
take
a
picture
of
the
deep
water
channel
that
dog-legged
in
from
the
west
.
We
flew
above
the
skeletal
radio
mast
and
I
stared
down
at
the
row
of
huge
houses
.
No
one
and
nothing
stirred
there
.
"
They
spent
a
fortune
developing
the
place
,
"
the
Maggot
said
,
"
but
the
rich
folks
never
came
,
so
they
sold
it
to
the
rich
dickheads

.
"
We
flew
out
across
the
northern
reefs
.
"
One
more

I
asked
John
.
"
Why

"
"
And
a
bit
lower
?
"
"
Yeah

.
"
He
had
turned
to
fly
around
the
eastern
edge
of
the
island
's
encircling
reefs
and
was
now
staring
intently
at
the
houses
,
searching
for
any
signs
of
danger
,
but
it
seemed
as
though
Murder
Cay
was
deserted
.
"
What
the
hell
,
"
the
Maggot
said
,
and
he
wrenched
the
plane
round
in
a
tight
turn
until
we
were
aimed
plumb
at
the
island
's
southernmost
tip
,
then
he
dropped
the
nose
ready
to
make
one
high
speed
and
low
level
pass
above
the
Cay
.
"
That
's
friendly
!
"
he
shouted
over
the
engine
noise
,
and
he
pointed
through
the
windscreen
at
the
concrete
airstrip
which
not
only
had
the
yellow
cross
painted
huge
at
its
western
end
,
but
also
had
two
trucks
parked
in
its
centre
line
,
thus
making
it
impossible
for
any
plane
to
land
.
Despite
the
obstructions
it
was
clear
that
aircraft
did
use
the
runway
,
for
it
was
marked
by
the
black
rubber
streaks
of
fresh
tyre
marks
,
but
the
two
trucks
,
together
with
the
yellow
cross
,
were
evidence
that
the
runway
could
only
be
used
by
invitation
.
We
slashed
across
the
shank
of
the
island
,
then
we
were
over
the
anchorage
and
I
had
a
glimpse
of
a
sailing
boat
's
shadow
black
on
the
bed
of
the
lagoon
before
our
own
winged
shadow
whipped
across
a
gaggle
of
powerboats
.
We
were
going
too
fast
to
see
any
details
of
the
moored
vessels
so
I
just
snapped
a
random
photograph
and
,
at
the
very
same
instant
,
the
Maggot
swore
and
banked
and
rammed
the
throttles
hard
forward
.
We
were
side-slipping
,
starboard
wing
down
,
falling
to
earth
with
our
engines
howling
.
I
flailed
for
support
as
the
camera
flew
up
to
the
padded
ceiling
.
The
Maggot
whooped
,
dragged
the
stick
back
and
our
earthwards
wing
lifted
and
suddenly
we
were
screaming
just
above
the
palm
trees
,
close
to
the
tiled
roofs
and
at
a
speed
that
seemed
to
be
doubled
because
of
our
proximity
to
the
ground
.
The
camera
,
re-entering
the
world
of
normal
gravity
,
dropped
hard
beside
my
shoes
.
Beer
bottles
were
everywhere
.
One
broke
,
shattering
liquid
across
the
side
windows
.
I
had
a
glimpse
of
a
fair-haired
girl
staring
wide-eyed
and
terrified
from
a
tennis
court
,
her
racket
held
loose
by
her
side
and
tennis
balls
scattered
at
her
feet
and
,
though
the
trees
and
buildings
and
gardens
were
nothing
but
a
high-speed
blur
,
my
mind
nevertheless
registered
with
a
startling
clarity
that
the
girl
had
been
completely
naked
.
The
plane
's
engines
were
screaming
.
We
whipped
over
the
northernmost
house
,
across
the
beach
,
and
thus
out
to
sea
again
.
"
What
the
hell
?
"
I
managed
to
ask
.
"
They
fired
at
us

goddamn
tracer
bullets

Jesus

"
The
Maggot
did
not
seem
scared
,
but
rather
stung
by
the
challenge
.
We
were
over
the
lagoon
now
,
racing
towards
the
northern
strands
of
the
Devil
's
Necklace
,
but
low
enough
so
that
the
wash
of
our
twin
propellers
was
whipping
the
blue
water
into
a
wake
of
white-hazed
foam
.
"
Shee-it
!
"
The
Maggot
said
with
inappropriate
exultation
,
then
twisted
his
head
to
stare
back
at
the
island
.
"
Let's
go
see
them
again
!
"
"
Are
you
sure
that
's
wise
?
"
I
asked
,
but
I
might
as
well
have
saved
my
breath
because
the
plane
suddenly
climbed
,
banked
,
then
began
descending
fast
towards
the
island
again
.
The
Maggot
was
growling
to
himself
,
relishing
the
confrontation
.
Sunlight
reflected
from
a
window
among
the
palm
trees
to
lance
a
sliver
of
dazzling
light
at
our
cockpit
,
then
the
reflection
was
gone
and
we
were
at
sea
level
,
engines
screaming
,
and
I
fumbled
for
the
camera
,
prayed
it
had
not
broken
when
it
fell
from
the
ceiling
,
and
took
another
picture
just
before
Maggot
lifted
the
aircraft
's
nose
so
that
we
swooped
up
and
over
the
palm
trees
that
edged
the
beach
.
He
jinked
left
,
then
right
,
throwing
the
plane
into
such
steep
and
sudden
turns
that
I
was
alternately
jerked
hard
against
the
cockpit
's
side
window
and
then
against
his
broad
shoulder
.
The
Maggot
was
not
taking
evasive
action
but
quartering
the
ground
in
search
of
our
enemy
.
"
There
!
"
he
said
abruptly
and
threw
the
plane
straight
again
,
but
this
time
dropping
the
nose
,
and
I
saw
a
jeep
churning
dust
from
the
dirt
road
which
ran
the
length
of
the
island
's
long
shank
,
between
the
golf
course
and
the
houses
,
and
just
as
I
saw
the
jeep
so
the
red
tracer
bullets
began
climbing
from
a
machine-gun
mounted
in
the
back
of
the
vehicle
.
"
Oh
,
Jesus
wept
,
"
I
said
,
snapped
a
last
picture
,
then
ducked
down
in
momentary
expectation
of
the
windscreen
shattering
into
a
million
bright
scraps
.
"
Fuck
you
,
"
the
Maggot
screamed
at
whoever
fired
at
him
and
I
looked
out
of
the
Beechcraft
's
side
window
to
see
palm
trees
going
past
at
over
150
miles
an
hour
and
above
us
.
Above
us
.
Truly
.
And
I
thought
it
really
had
been
a
very
good
life
,
a
fun
life
,
despite
Ellen
never
having
gone
to
bed
with
me
,
and
I
wondered
if
my
father
would
even
notice
my
death
,
then
the
Maggot
whooped
with
glee
,
hauled
back
on
the
stick
,
and
our
plane
was
screaming
up
into
the
wide
blue
lovely
bullet-free
sky
and
the
Maggot
was
laughing
and
slapping
my
shoulder
.
"
Was
n't
that
just
the
best
goddamned
fun
you
can
have
this
side
of
a
blanket
?
"
"
Was
it
?
"
"
You
missed
it
?
"
He
sounded
aggrieved
and
astonished
.
"
Missed
what
?
"
"
I
ran
that
turkey
clean
off
the
road
!
Shit
,
but
I
gave
that
bastard
a
headache
!
"
"
I
think
you
gave
me
one
too
,
"
I
said
,
then
,
very
gingerly
,
I
straightened
up
and
twisted
round
to
see
that
Murder
Cay
was
far
behind
us
and
well
out
of
machine-gun
range
.
"
You
're
mad
,
"
I
courteously
informed
John
Maggovertski
.
He
laughed
.
"
You
're
the
one
who
wanted
to
see
the
island
.
"
We
were
gently
circling
northwards
now
,
heading
for
home
.
"
So
now
you
've
seen
it
.
"
I
tried
to
relax
,
letting
the
cold
air
from
the
vent
cool
the
sweat
from
my
face
.
My
right
hand
shook
as
I
remembered
the
sudden
fear
of
seeing
the
crimson
tracer
flick
up
from
the
ground
.
"
Hell
!
"
I
protested
.
"
They
ca
n't
just
open
fire
!
"
The
Maggot
grinned
through
the
black
tangle
of
his
beard
.
"
Nick
,
they
are
richer
than
your
wettest
dreams
,
and
like
all
the
very
rich
they
think
they
are
above
the
law
.
"
He
was
speaking
very
casually
,
but
I
saw
that
his
right
hand
,
like
mine
,
was
shaking
.
It
is
not
pleasant
to
be
shot
at
,
and
even
the
pleasure
of
being
missed
is
spoilt
by
the
mind
's
habit
of
constructing
alternative
scenarios
;
if
the
machine-gunner
had
been
a
bit
quicker
to
react
,
or
had
led
us
with
more
skill
,
we
would
now
be
nothing
but
a
heap
of
molten
metal
somewhere
in
the
sea-grape
.
The
Maggot
shook
his
head
.
"
Do
you
have
any
idea
just
how
rich
these
people
are
?
"
"
Very
,
I
imagine
.
"
"
There
's
an
island
not
far
from
here
that
has
just
two
thousand
inhabitants
,
and
last
year
,
Nick
,
according
to
a
banker
I
sometimes
fly
to
Miami
,
those
two
thousand
dirt
poor
and
unemployed
islanders
deposited
24.3
million
dollars
in
the
one
and
only
bank
on
their
impoverished
little
island
.
"
The
Maggot
laughed
.
"
Not
bad
,
eh
?
And
I
do
not
believe
that
24.3
million
dollars
a
year
is
the
average
reward
for
selling
coconut
milk
and
conch
shells
to
honky
tourists
.
That
money
is
pure
commission
,
Nick
,
a
mere
ten
per
cent
of
the
value
of
the
cocaine
that
was
stored
on
their
island
while
it
awaited
transportation
to
the
good
old
US
of
A
;
and
neither
you
,
nor
I
,
nor
even
the
dickheads
in
the
Drug
Enforcement
Administration
will
ever
know
just
how
much
money
was
not
put
in
the
bank
,
but
stored
in
paper
bags
under
the
bed
.
"
He
sounded
depressed
by
the
thought
,
but
then
cheered
himself
up
by
asking
me
for
a
beer
.
I
opened
two
bottles
that
I
retrieved
from
the
sticky
mess
on
the
cabin
floor
.
We
flew
the
rest
of
the
way
home
in
silence
.
It
was
not
till
we
saw
the
captive
aerostat
balloon
with
its
ever
watching
radar
that
the
Americans
had
hoisted
over
Grand
Bahama
to
probe
for
boats
or
aircraft
smuggling
drugs
,
that
the
Maggot
again
spoke
,
and
by
then
he
had
recaptured
all
his
old
insouciance
.
"
At
this
time
,
if
you
'd
care
to
fold
up
your
tray
table
and
extinguish
your
hopes

shall
land
this
little
sucker

you

"
They
did
not
,
and
thus
I
came
back
to
Wavebreaker
.
I
went
back
to
the
Maggot
's
foul
house
,
where
he
kept
his
killer
dog
and
astonishing
collection
of
guns
,
and
we
sat
on
his
makeshift
verandah
that
overlooked
a
noxious
and
polluted
creek
and
shared
a
few
whiskies
as
he
told
me
an
incredibly
tedious
tale
of
how
he
had
once
sacked
the
quarterback
of
the
San
Francisco
Sugar
Plums
.
I
retaliated
with
detailed
instructions
on
how
to
bowl
off-breaks
to
left-handers
on
a
drying
pitch
,
and
we
eventually
declared
a
truce
as
we
watched
the
sun
sink
across
the
oil-storage
tanks
beyond
the
creek
.
He
offered
me
his
spare
bed
for
the
night
,
but
I
could
not
stand
the
stench
of
the
creek
,
and
I
wanted
to
make
an
early
start
on
the
work
I
had
to
do
on
Wavebreaker
,
so
I
caught
the
bus
to
McIllvanney
's
boatyard
.
Naturally
no
one
was
there
and
the
gate
was
locked
and
the
top
of
the
fence
was
rimmed
with
razor-wire
so
I
could
not
climb
it
.
I
had
not
kept
my
old
key
,
because
I
had
hoped
that
my
association
with
Cutwater
Charters
was
done
,
so
I
was
forced
to
carry
my
heavy
pack
into
the
tangle
of
dark
alleys
that
lay
behind
the
straw
market
and
where
I
planned
to
find
Ellen
and
borrow
her
key
.
A
tribe
of
stray
cats
scattered
as
I
turned
into
the
yard
where
Ellen
's
apartment
lay
.
The
archway
was
bright
with
the
brass
plates
of
the
dozens
of
corporations
who
were
registered
at
the
address
to
avoid
paying
tax
in
their
home
countries
.
The
courtyard
was
inhabited
by
three
tethered
goats
that
stared
malevolently
at
me
.
The
open-air
stairways
were
shadowed
with
creepers
and
flickering
with
the
eerie
lights
of
televisions
that
glowed
from
within
the
screened
windows
of
the
small
apartments
.
I
climbed
the
two
flights
of
stairs
and
walked
down
the
rickety
balcony
which
led
to
Ellen
's
small
end
room
.
A
child
was
screaming
in
one
of
the
flats
,
while
two
dogs
were
snarling
as
they
fought
in
the
wasteland
beyond
the
apartment
house
.
The
chorus
of
televisions
was
tuned
to
an
American
game
show
in
which
competing
families
were
leaping
up
and
down
and
screaming
with
apparent
incontinence
because
they
had
won
a
trip
to
Disneyworld
.
Then
,
above
all
those
discordant
sounds
,
I
heard
Ellen
's
voice
rise
in
sudden
indignation
.
"
No
!
No
!
No
!
"
I
stopped
outside
her
open
window
.
Her
room
was
lit
by
a
single
naked
bulb
which
hung
from
the
ceiling
and
shone
harshly
on
Ellen
who
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
her
tiny
bathroom
.
She
was
facing
the
window
,
but
did
not
see
me
beyond
its
screen
because
she
was
staring
at
Matthew
McIllvanney
who
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
room
with
his
malevolence
.
"
I
'm
just
asking
you
to
think
about
it
,
"
I
heard
him
say
in
a
calm
voice
.
"
I
've
thought
"
-
I
could
see
Ellen
was
trying
hard
to
recover
her
composure

"
and
the
answer
is
no
.
"
"
Six
hundred
.
"
McIllvanney
's
persistence
in
the
face
of
any
refusal
was
monotonous
and
relentless
.
"
And
I
wo
n't
even

my
usual
commission
on
that
,
so

'll
get
to
keep
it
all

remember
the
agreed
price
is
just
a
guaranteed
minimum

"
"
This

Bellybutton
laughed
suggestively
.
He
was
standing
just
inside
the
front
door
and
was
thus
hidden
from
me
.
"
Shut
up
,
you
black
bastard
,
"
McIllvanney
snapped
,
then
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
.
A
small
battery-powered
fan
whirled
the
smoke
away
and
generally
tried
to
stir
up
the
humid
air
which
played
such
havoc
with
Ellen
's
precious
books
in
their
orange-crate
shelves
.
The
Ulsterman
blew
smoke
towards
her
.
"

n't

he
said
,
"

'll

you
're
wanting
to
save

So

yourself

he
's
willing
to

Ellen
shouted
again
.
"
He

McIllvanney
said
dubiously
,
as
though
the
price
was
the
only
possible
objection
Ellen
might
have
to
whoring
herself
.
That
was
as
far
as
the
conversation
went
,
for
I
decided
to
end
it
by
pushing
open
the
screen
door
.
All
three
stared
in
astonishment
as
I
tossed
my
kit
bag
on
to
the
floor
.

slammed
the

over

narrow

used
the

it

McIllvanney
laughed

stepped
quickly
back

sensed
I
might
bring
my
knee
up
into
his
balls

counter-attacking

he
jabbed
the

to
stare

he
spoke
to

cackling
behind

The

away

shocked
by
McIllvanney

offer

,
at
the

she
was
paradoxically
surprised
at
herself

being
so
shocked

was

angry
with
herself
to
be
assuaged
by

even
interested
in
my
sympathy

She
paced
up

down
the
tiny
room

I
sat
on
her
bed

she
explained

seen
Ellen

offer
her
the
money

McIllvanney
had
made
the
offer
very
dispassionately
,

that
businesslike
approach
only
seemed
to
add
to
Ellen
's
fury

seven

She
shuddered
,
then
plucked
some
typed
sheets
of
paper
from
the
small
table
under
the
window
and
stuffed
them
into
a
folder
.
The
floor
was
crowded
with
cardboard
boxes
that
were
filled
with
leaflets
for
the
Literacy
Project
that
Ellen
helped
in
her
spare
time
.
I
idly
picked
up
one
of
the
leaflets
which
had
two
pictures
on
its
cover
;
the
first
illustration
showed
a
happy
black
family
,
all
neatly
dressed
and
reading
books
around
a
table
that
was
filled
with
platefuls
of
food
and
with
jugs
labelled
"
milk
"
.
The
second
picture
,
clearly
designed
to
demonstrate
the
rewards
of
illiteracy
,
showed
a
scabby-looking
native
dressed
in
a
threadbare
loincloth
who
crouched
in
the
mud
outside
a
grass
hut
and
who
seemed
to
be
sharing
his
lunch
bowl
with
a
baboon
.
Ellen
caught
my
eye
,
looked
down
at
the
ridiculous
leaflet
,
and
suddenly
we
both
began
to
laugh
helplessly
.
"

had
tears
in

eyes

to
recover
from
the
laughter

went
into

made
my
own
supper

slicing
some
of
the
foul
cheese

shoving
it
between
two
slices

greased
plastic
bread

I
ate
the
sandwich

I
walked
back

perversely
unhappy

the
Crowninshield

had
nagged
me

it

behaved
as

done

a
disservice

doing
so

put
down

mad

said
nothing

Ellen
had
bought
some
melon

coffee
on
her
way

boatyard

we
were
eating
a
late
breakfast

pressure-hosing
a
hull
across
the
yard

McIllvanney
was
evidently
taking
another
day
off

hoped
that
he
was
avoiding

felt
ashamed

offer

Matthew
McIllvanney
had
ever
felt
ashamed

anything

Ellen
said
in
a
tone

implied
that
I
had
entirely
misunderstood
the
senator
's
motives

she
would
now
have
to
explain
to
me

the
application

sound
feminist
arguments

Sound
feminist
argument
usually

the
nearest
male
look

idiot

case
was
not

"
Cocaine
thus
became
another
of
the
subjects
which
Ellen
and
I
decorously
avoided
,
like
the
existence
of
God
,
the
wisdom
of
my
having
been
a
marine
,
feminism
and
the
cartoons
in
the
New
Yorker
.
Ellen
was
adamantly
opposed
to
the
first
two
and
a
noisy
supporter
of
the
last
two
,
while
my
position
was
more
or
less
the
opposite
.
God
alone
knew
why
we
wanted
to
sail
to
New
Zealand
together
,
except
that
in
a
strange
way
we
were
friends
.
But
for
the
moment
we
were
friends
who
had
to
prepare
Wavebreaker
for
a
possible
Atlantic
crossing
.
Thessy
and
I
would
have
a
chance
to
strengthen
the
rigging
during
our
two-week
trial
period
with
the
twins
,
but
some
jobs
simply
could
not
be
done
at
sea
.
Thus
I
stripped
out
all
Wavebreaker
's
unnecessary
furniture
and
equipment
,
and
I
installed
extra
fresh-water
tanks
and
fuel
bunkers
.
I
made
storm
shields
for
the
big
cabin
windows
and
skylights
.
They
were
a
delight
for
the
charterers
in
the
Bahamian
lagoons
,
but
in
an
Atlantic
storm
such
wide
windows
could
be
our
death
warrants
for
if
Wavebreaker
fell
off
a
big
wave
the
glass
could
be
driven
out
of
the
windows
and
the
boat
be
filling
with
water
in
seconds
,
and
so
I
cut
and
shaped
sheet
steel
shutters
that
could
be
bolted
over
the
boat
's
glass
at
the
first
sign
of
bad
weather
.
The
shutters
'
anchor
points
had
to
be
welded
to
the
hull
and
,
especially
at
the
stern
where
the
windows
wrapped
round
Wavebreaker
's
counter
,
the
bolts
looked
intrusive
and
ugly
,
but
better
that
than
to
be
a
good-looking
boat
fifty
fathoms
down
and
still
sinking
.
Ellen
and
I
worked
hard
that
week
and
,
on
the
Saturday
,
as
though
to
commiserate
with
ourselves
on
this
being
our
last
day
alone
together
,
we
stopped
work
at
midday
and
took
a
bus
to
Mama
Sipcott
's
Cafe
on
the
beach
where
we
ate
lobster
and
drank
too
much
of
Mama
's
sticky-sweet
white
wine
.
Ellen
proposed
a
toast
to
the
prospect
of
her
first
Atlantic
crossing
under
sail
.
I
drank
to
the
toast
,
though
I
was
not
at
all
sure
that
we
would
actually
make
the
crossing
in
Wavebreaker
.
The
best
season
for
an
eastwards
voyage
was
already
past
,
though
it
was
just
possible
that
we
might
run
far
north
and
cross
in
the
high
latitudes
where
,
even
in
summer
,
we
could
expect
fog
,
rain
and
cold
.
I
knew
Ellen
hated
the
cold
,
and
I
tried
to
warn
her
of
the
conditions
we
might
expect
in
those
latitudes
.
I
told
her
of
the
big
green
seas
,
all
crinkled
and
slow
,
heaving
up
astern
as
the
icy
wind
scoured
their
tops
into
freezing
spume
.
Ellen
smiled
at
my
enthusiastic
description
.
"

poetic
and
romantic
Nick
.
"
She
cocked
her
head
on
one
side
and
gave
me
a
long
scrutiny
,
almost
as
though
she
had
never
seen
me
before

we
probably

the
daylight

grey

you
just
see
the
cold
white
wavetops
hissing
out

blackness

seemed
curious
to
be
describing
such
ice-cold
seas
while
sitting
in
a
palm-thatched
Bahamian
beach
cafe
that
looked
on
to
a
shoreline
where
pelicans
perched
under
the
diamond-hard
sun
.

good

a

stop
the
seas

down

neck

good
sea-boots

many
pairs

was
lucky
Nick
and
she
was
pretty
Ellen
,
and
so
I
ordered
another
bottle
of
the
sticky
white
wine
and
we
let
our
dreams
take
wings
.
For
we
were
going
to
sea
.
Ellen
and
I
lingered
on
in
Mama
Sipcott
's
for
another
hour
and
a
half
;
indulging
in
the
sailor
's
shorebound
pastime
of
planning
the
perfect
voyage
.
We
decided
that
Masquerade
would
sail
from
the
Bahamas
to
Panama
,
and
thence
to
the
Galapagos
where
we
would
find
Darwin
's
giant
tortoises
.
Then
we
would
sail
south
to
Easter
Island
to
explore
the
mysterious
statues
before
going
to
the
mutineers
'
refuge
on
Pitcairn
Island
.
After
that
we
would
go
to
Tahiti
,
and
I
saw
the
excitement
grow
in
Ellen
as
she
realised
that
these
plans
were
so
close
to
coming
true
.
It
was
an
excitement
that
matched
my
own
,
for
I
had
never
sailed
the
South
Seas
and
I
had
long
dreamed
of
that
scatter
of
tiny
,
magically
named
islands
strewn
across
one
third
of
a
globe
.
By
the
time
we
had
drunk
our
third
bottle
of
wine
Ellen
and
I
had
long
reached
New
Zealand
and
were
already
sailing
north
towards
New
Caledonia
.
We
were
happy
.
We
caught
the
bus
back
to
Ellen
's
apartment
and
collected
her
clothes
and
notebooks
.
She
was
moving
back
on
board
Wavebreaker
in
preparation
for
the
next
day
's
early
departure
.
I
carried
her
luggage
to
the
yard
,
noting
that
even
Ellen
's
strident
feminism
evaporated
in
the
face
of
two
heavy
bags
and
tropical
heat
.
Once
in
the
boatyard
Ellen
ran
ahead
of
me
,
evidently
eager
to
reach
Wavebreaker
's
air
conditioning
.
Then
,
as
she
reached
the
dock
's
edge
,
she
suddenly
checked
.
"
What
on
earth
is
that
?
Oh
,
no
!
"
She
began
to
run
again
.
When
I
reached
the
water
's
edge
I
understood
her
dismay
.
A
large
sports-fishing
boat
was
moored
alongside
Wavebreaker
,
but
moored
so
crudely
that
whoever
had
brought
the
powerboat
alongside
the
schooner
had
not
bothered
to
put
out
fenders
,
but
instead
had
gouged
long
ugly
gashes
in
Wavebreaker
's
white
paint
.
Yet
even
the
gashes
were
not
so
ugly
as
the
expensive
boat
that
had
caused
them
.
There
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
boat
's
lines
,
which
were
sleekly
functional
,
but
her
long
powerful
hull
,
her
upperworks
,
and
even
the
interior
of
her
capacious
working
deck
had
all
been
painted
with
a
wartime
dazzle
paint
.
The
seemingly
random
and
jagged-edged
pattern
of
blue
,
black
,
silver
,
green
and
white
had
been
designed
to
disguise
a
boat
's
shape
from
the
prying
eyes
of
U-Boat
captains
,
so
it
seemed
somewhat
fanciful
to
thus
camouflage
a
pleasure
boat
in
the
Bahamas
.
This
boat
was
called
Dream
Baby
,
and
she
was
clearly
an
expensive
infant
for
rods
and
whip-aerials
and
outriggers
splayed
from
her
upperworks
like
the
antennae
of
some
outlandish
insect
.
She
boasted
a
harpoon
walkway
,
a
flybridge
,
and
,
above
the
highest
wheel-platform
,
an
aluminium
canopy
which
held
a
radar
aerial
.
The
fighting
chair
on
her
aft
deck
had
thick
white
leather
straps
giving
it
the
appearance
of
a
padded
electric
chair
,
while
the
dazzle
paint
gave
the
boat
an
oddly
military
look
that
was
completed
by
the
number
666
that
was
painted
on
her
bows
in
silver-edged
black
numerals
like
those
warships
use
to
display
their
commissioning
numbers
.
The
boat
's
wrap-around
windscreens
were
made
of
black
polarised
glass
which
only
added
to
Dream
Baby
's
ugly
air
of
menace
.
Ellen
,
unencumbered
with
luggage
,
had
already
reached
Wavebreaker
and
taken
two
plastic
fenders
from
a
locker
.
She
swung
lithely
down
to
Dream
Baby
's
gaudily
painted
deck
and
cushioned
the
two
hulls
.
"
How
bad
is
the
damage
?
"
I
called
down
to
her
when
I
reached
Wavebreaker
.
"
It
's
scraped
back
to
bare
metal
!
"
"
I
'll
give
it
some
paint
.
"
Wavebreaker
's
hull
was
made
of
steel
and
,
while
such
hulls
are
marvellously
strong
and
safe
,
they
are
soon
weakened
if
their
steel
is
exposed
to
salt
air
.
I
had
to
paint
the
gashes
as
soon
as
possible
so
that
rust
would
not
begin
to
bite
into
Wavebreaker
's
long
sleekness
.
Ellen
looked
around
the
oddly
painted
powerboat
.
"
You
'd
think
someone
rich
enough
to
own
a
rig
like
this
could
afford
a
pair
of
fenders
.
"
"
Who
cares
?
Just
cut
the
damn
boat
loose
,
"
I
said
vengefully
.
Ellen
ignored
my
advice
while
I
,
obedient
to
the
rule
that
if
a
job
needed
doing
then
do
it
without
delay
,
found
a
pot
of
white
paint
and
dug
through
the
locker
for
a
clean
brush
.
Then
,
from
behind
me
,
an
unfamiliar
voice
sounded
:
"
Oh
,
ring
my
bells
.
"
It
was
a
man
's
voice
;
drawling
and
lazy
.
I
twisted
around
and
almost
blinded
myself
by
staring
straight
into
the
sun
,
but
then
,
through
the
dizzying
glare
,
I
made
out
the
long
silhouette
of
a
tall
man
who
seemed
,
incongruously
,
to
be
dressed
in
a
long
,
transparent
dressing
gown
.
He
was
emerging
in
stately
fashion
from
Wavebreaker
's
companionway
and
,
though
I
could
see
he
was
tall
and
lanky
and
had
a
ponytail
of
hair
,
I
could
make
out
no
details
of
his
face
.
"
Who
the
hell
are
you
?
"
I
demanded
.
The
man
ignored
me
,
walking
instead
towards
Ellen
who
,
dressed
only
in
shorts
and
T-shirt
,
was
climbing
long-legged
over
Wavebreaker
's
rail
.
"
Be
still
my
restless
heart
,
"
the
man
had
a
strong
,
caressing
voice
and
the
slow
luscious
accent
of
America
's
deep
south
.
"
Dear
lady
,
dear
lady
,
to
think
that
I
might
have
lived
my
whole
life
through
and
never
seen
you
.
Oh
,
lay
me
down
,
just
lay
me
down
.
"
Ellen
,
usually
so
quick
with
a
scornful
reply
,
just
stood
and
stared
at
the
elegant
stranger
who
stopped
one
pace
away
from
her
,
took
her
hand
,
then
bowed
above
her
fingers
.
He
kissed
the
air
a
fastidiously
polite
inch
above
her
knuckles
,
then
closed
his
eyes
.
"
Dear
sweet
Lord
above
,
I
do
thank
Thee
for
Thy
kindness
in
showing
me
this
lovely
woman
before
I
died
.
"
To
my
astonishment
and
chagrin
Ellen
left
her
hand
in
his
as
he
opened
his
eyes
and
smiled
at
her
.
"
My
name
,
"
he
stroked
her
with
his
voice
,
"
is
Jesse
Isambard
Sweetman
.
And
who
,
dear
creature
,
are
you
?
"
Ellen
still
said
nothing
.
I
had
straightened
up
and
moved
aside
so
that
the
sun
no
longer
dazzled
me
and
I
could
see
Sweetman
properly
,
and
what
I
saw
I
did
not
like
.
His
face
was
old
and
young
,
sardonic
and
knowing
,
amused
and
handsome
;
the
face
of
a
man
who
has
seen
the
world
's
wickedness
and
knows
how
to
match
it
with
his
own
.
His
long
black
hair
was
tied
into
its
ponytail
with
a
velvet
ribbon
,
his
skin
was
parchment
pale
,
and
his
eyes
dark
.
I
put
his
age
at
forty
,
but
even
among
men
twenty
years
younger
he
would
have
been
accounted
handsome
,
and
he
knew
it
,
for
his
expression
showed
both
confidence
and
amusement
as
he
continued
to
hold
Ellen
's
hand
,
and
he
showed
even
more
amusement
when
she
suddenly
realised
just
what
liberty
she
was
thus
granting
him
and
jerked
her
fingers
swiftly
away
.
Thus
released
,
Jesse
Sweetman
turned
to
look
at
me
.
The
dressing
gown
had
proved
to
be
a
long
,
stylish
,
ankle-length
duster
coat
which
was
loosely
woven
from
a
delicate
white
cotton
.
Beneath
the
filmy
topcoat
he
wore
a
black
shirt
and
black
trousers
that
were
tucked
into
tall
black
boots
.
It
was
a
dramatic
and
impractical
outfit
of
a
kind
I
only
expected
to
see
on
the
male
models
who
posed
in
the
more
outlandish
fashion
magazines
that
our
rich
clients
brought
aboard
Wavebreaker
,
yet
Jesse
Isambard
Sweetman
managed
to
wear
the
elaborate
style
with
an
elegant
insouciance
.
The
only
incongruous
note
was
a
cheap
round
badge
,
enamelled
in
red
and
yellow
,
that
he
wore
on
his
shirt
,
which
bore
the
legend
"
Just
Say
No
!
"
.
"
You
must
be
Nicholas
Breakspear
,
"
he
said
carelessly
,
as
though
he
did
not
much
care
whether
I
was
or
not
.
"
Is
that
gaudy
piece
of
junk
your
boat
?
"
I
gestured
to
where
Dream
Baby
's
aerials
showed
above
Wavebreaker
's
gunwale
.
Sweetman
turned
and
pretended
to
notice
the
sports-fishing
boat
for
the
first
time
.
"
No
,
"
he
said
helpfully
,
then
bestowed
a
patronising
smile
on
me
.
"
You
look
so
like
your
father
.
It
's
really
uncanny
.
"
"
Did
you
bring
that
boat
here
?
"
I
persevered
.
"
Oh
,
indeed
I
did
,
"
he
said
brightly
,
as
though
he
merely
indulged
a
rather
dim
child
's
curiosity
.
"
Your
mother
was
Malise
Fielding
,
am
I
right
?
Or
are
you
Lucy
de
Sills
"
son
?
"
"
Why
the
hell
did
n't
you
use
fenders
when
you
tied
alongside
?
"
He
sighed
,
intimating
what
a
bore
I
was
being
.
"
I
did
not
use
fenders
,
Breakspear
,
because
I
despise
precautions
.
Precautions
are
the
symptoms
of
small
and
fearful
minds
.
Precautions
will
not
conquer
empires
,
they
will
not
build
great
cities
,
they
will
not
transmute
dreams
into
gold
or
carry
men
across
wide
oceans
,
and
precautions
will
not
,
emphatically
not
,
win
fair
ladies
,
"
and
here
he
turned
to
Ellen
and
lasciviously
dropped
his
gaze
to
her
long
bare
legs
.
Ellen
twisted
away
and
Sweetman
laughed
at
her
obvious
discomfiture
,
then
,
as
coolly
as
though
he
owned
Wavebreaker
,
he
stepped
down
into
the
central
cockpit
where
he
first
brushed
at
,
then
sat
on
,
one
of
the
white
cushioned
seats
by
the
ship
's
wheel
.
"
I
've
had
a
look
round
the
boat
,
"
he
said
very
coolly
,
"
and
I
approve
of
her
.
So
tell
me
the
cost
of
a
week
's
charter
.
"
"
The
man
you
want

I
said
,
"
is
called
Matthew
McIllvanney

his
office
is
the
pink
building
with
the
outside

.
He
's
not
here
this
afternoon
,
but
you
can
doubtless
telephone
him
next
week
.
"
Sweetman
took
a
pair
of
polarised
sunglasses
from
his
shirt
pocket
and
put
them
on
before
inspecting
me
again
.
He
did
not
seem
to
like
what
he
saw
.
"
You
're
really
not
being
noticeably
helpful

"
he
said
after
a
pause
,
"
so
let
us
try
again

we

Would
you
please

me

"
"
How
many
passengers

"
Ellen
asked
before
I
could
refuse
to
answer
.
Sweetman
paused
again
,
this
time
to
light
a
long
pale
blue
cigarette
with
a
slim
gold
lighter
.
He
shrugged
.
"
Two

six
passengers

it
really
matter

"
"
One

ten
thousand
US
dollars

another
thousand
bucks

"
Ellen
's
voice
was
cold
,
as
though
she
disliked
satisfying
his
curiosity
.
"
And
to

Sweetman
asked
carelessly

flatly

Sweetman

amused

unfolded
his

thin
legs

he
said

me

I
was
surprised
that
he
so
eagerly
sought
to
confront
me

I
am
not
a
small
man
,

am
I
a
weakling
,
yet
the
thin
Sweetman
seemed
unconcerned
as
I
jumped
down
into
the
cockpit
.
Then
I
saw
why
he
was
so
confident
.
He
put
a
hand
into
a
pocket
of
his
elegant
duster
coat
and
brought
out
a
small
.22
pistol
that
he
pointed
at
my
face

Ellen
called
warningly
,
as
though
I
might
not
have
seen
the
gun

The
gun
's
threat
had
not
stopped
my
advance
.
I
was
calling
Sweetman
's
bluff
,
confident
he
would
not
dare
pull
the
trigger
,
and
equally
confident
that
my
marine
training
would
let
me
turn
him
into
mincemeat
.
I
was
also
half
drunk
,

thus
filled
with
the
Dutch
courage
offered
by
Mama
Sipcott
's
worst
white

Sweetman
stood
.
There
was
,
at
last
,
a
look
of
alarm
on
his
face

I
could
see
him
wondering
whether
he
really
would
have
to
pull
the
small
trigger

He
held
the
gun
pointed
at
my
eyes

I
began
to
fear
that
he
would
fire
,
and
a
small
sober
part
of
my
brain
registered
just
how
foolish
this
confrontation
was
;
a
contest
caused
solely
by
two
male
egos
over
a
girl
sworn
to
celibacy

Ellen
's
voice
was
suddenly
a
harsh
scream
,
so
harsh
that
we
both
looked
towards
her
and
saw
that
she
was
threatening
both
of
us
with
one
of
Wavebreaker
's
heavy-duty
fire
extinguishers
that
she
had
snatched
from
its
rack
at
the
head
of
the
main
companionway
.
The
cylinder
was
filled
with
a
compressed
chemical
that
would
have
smothered
both
Sweetman
and
me
in
an
avalanche
of
nauseating
foam
.
"
Step
back
,
Nick

Ellen
said
to
me
,
her
voice
recovering
its
normal
timbre
.
"
But
I
'm
only
going

I
said
reasonably
.

manly

Ellen
said
coldly
,
"
so
step
back

Nick
.
"
She
menaced
me
with
the
extinguisher
's
nozzle
and
,
because
I
knew
Ellen
did
not
make
idle
threats
,
and
because
I
knew
she
despised
all
displays
of
macho
violence
,
I
obediently
stepped
backwards
and
watched
as
she
transferred
the
extinguisher
's
aim
to
Sweetman
.
"
Leave
us.

she
said
.
"
Listen

I

most
confidently
patronising
smile

lady

Ellen
squeezed
the
lever
.
There
was
a
gulp
from
the
extinguisher
's
valve
and
a
trickle
of
yellow-white
liquid
dribbled
pathetically
from
its
nozzle
.
Sweetman
crowed
with
laughter
,
but
too
soon
,
for
,
just
as
it
seemed
as
though
Ellen
's
gesture
had
indeed
collapsed
into
an
ignominious
anti-climax
,
the
extinguisher
first
coughed
,
then
spat
a
vicious
deluge
of
white
muck
that
fanned
from
the
flared
nozzle
to
splatter
spectacularly
against
Sweetman
's
chest
.
He
staggered
back
,
half
tripped
on
the
cockpit
coaming
,
scrambled
up
to
the
deck
and
then
to
the
ship
's
rail
.
Ellen
,
who
was
utterly
delighted
with
her
achievement
,
followed
him
to
spray
the
churning
mess
over
his
hair
,
then
down
on
to
the
decks
of
Dream
Baby
as
Sweetman
jumped
panic-stricken
from
our
gunwale
.
"

she
called

"

Ellen
was
laughing
as
she
tried
to
stop
the
gunk
that
still
spewed
from
the
cylinder
.
Sweetman
,
safe
under
Dream
Baby
's
canopy
,
was
starting
his
motors
.
He
risked
a
soaking
of
foam
as
he
darted
out
to
cut
his
mooring
lines
,
then
twisted
Dream
Baby
's
wheel
and
thrust
her
throttles
forward
.
Ellen
was
laughing
like
a
child
let
loose
in
a
sweet
shop
.
"
It
wo
n't

she
said
again
.
"
Throw

I
did
n't
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
cleaning
foam
from
Wavebreaker
's
decks

Ellen
hurled
the
still
discharging
extinguisher
over
the
side
.
The
cylinder
bounced
hard
on
Dream
Baby
's
dazzle-painted
transom
,
then
sank
in
the
clear
water
where
,
resting
on
the
sea-bed
,
it
continued
to
discharge
its
disgusting
foam
.
Sweetman
turned
a
furious
smeared
face
at
us
,
then
drove
his
garish
boat
hard
at
Wavebreaker
's
hull
to
gouge
a
long
scratch
down
to
the
bare
metal
.
I
heard
the
screech
of
protesting
steel
,
then
the
powerboat
bounced
off
our
hull
and
accelerated
away
so
that
,
within
seconds
,
its
powerful
drives
were
swirling
the
sea
into
twin
sprays
of
white
water
.
"
Damn
him

I
leaned
over
the
rail
to
inspect
the
new
scratch
in
Wavebreaker
's
paint
.
"
Did
n't
I
do
well

Ellen
asked
proudly
.
I
had
to
laugh
.
"

wonderfully

"
"

had

gun

"
She
sounded
astonished
,
and
I
knew
that
the
real
danger
of
the
moment
was
only
just
occurring
to
her
.
"
For
someone

hates
violence

I
agreed
,
"

used
force

skill

Ellen
turned
to
look
at
the
rapidly
disappearing
Dream
Baby
.
"
I
thought
he
was
kind
of
cute

"
"
Cute

I
was
astonished
by
her
.
"

"

"
"
Bloody

I
said
,
and
decided
that
I
would
never
understand
women
.
"
You
'd
better
check
that
your
cute
friend
did
n't
steal
anything
when
he
was
down
below
.
"
It
took
me
two
hours
to
paint
out
the
damage
that
Sweetman
had
caused
to
our
hull
.
Ellen
meanwhile
cleared
the
foam
from
the
teak
deck
,
then
searched
Wavebreaker
's
cabins
.
She
reported
that
Jesse
Sweetman
appeared
to
have
stolen
nothing
and
,
except
for
the
padlock
on
the
companionway
,
had
damaged
nothing
either
.
Ellen
and
I
both
assumed
that
Sweetman
's
interest
in
Wavebreaker
had
been
merely
that
of
a
prospective
charterer
who
wanted
to
reconnoitre
the
boat
's
amenities
.
So
I
forgot
about
him
,
at
least
until
that
evening
when
I
gave
Ellen
some
practice
with
the
sextant
.
She
was
trying
to
master
celestial
navigation
and
I
stood
beside
her
as
she
trapped
Altair
in
the
mirror
,
then
delicately
and
successfully
brought
the
star
down
to
the
horizon
.
She
read
the
star
's
altitude
off
the
sextant
's
micrometer
,
and
I
dutifully
jotted
down
the
numbers
and
the
time
of
day
for
her
.
"
Does
666
mean
anything
?
"
I
suddenly
asked
,
remembering
the
numerals
painted
on
Dream
Baby
's
bows
.
"
Of
course
it
does

"
Ellen
was
already
trying
to
identify
another
star
.
"
It
's
the
number
of
the
Beast
,
the
anti-Christ
,

personification
of
everything

's
evil

"
"

I
said

Ellen
looked
at

looked
out
to
sea

almost
as
though
I
expected
to
see
a
puff
of
smoke
and
a
beast
with
a
forked
tail
appear
from
the
darkness

"

said
in
an
unexpectedly
sober
voice

suddenly
,
and
for
no
particular
reason
on
a
very
warm
night
,
we
both
shivered

McIllvanney

yard
had
been
deserted
on
Saturday
afternoon
,
on
Sunday
morning
it
was
unnaturally
busy

Thessy
arrived
first
,
tired
after
an
uncomfortable
night
on
the
ferry
,
and
five
minutes
later
Bellybutton
half
danced
and
half
shuffled
down
the
pontoon
with
a
can
of
paint
and
a
pocketful
of
rags
and
brushes
.
He
arranged
his
materials
on
Starkisser
's
long
midnight-blue
bows
and
,
seeing
my
interest
,
offered
an
explanation
.
"

end

gets

"
Ten
minutes
later
Mr
Mac
himself
arrived
,
blasting
his
big
Kawasaki
into
the
yard
before
strolling
down
the
quay
to
cast
his
sceptical
gaze
at
Wavebreaker
.
"
She
looks
all
right

"
he
said
grudgingly
,
then
he
crossed
the
gangplank
for
a
closer
look
.
"
Good

he
asked
Thessy

He
stared
defiantly
at
Ellen
who
,
standing
at
the
stern
just
above
Wavebreaker
's
swimming
platform
,
nodded
back
very
coolly
.
McIllvanney
turned
back
to
me
and
dropped
his
voice
very
slightly

peered

straightened

the
Ulsterman
collected
the
full
fifteen

meant

eighteen

on
an
impulse
,
I
asked

McIllvanney
had
ever
met
a
man
called
Jesse
Sweetman

McIllvanney
did
not
even
need

think
about
his
answer

just
shook
his
head

McIllvanney
said
angrily
,
then
turned
to
look
at
the
yard
where
a
silver-grey
stretch
limo
,
its
windows
tinted
black
against
the
sun
,
rolled
ponderously
to
park
beside
the
stairs
to
his
office
.
He
scowled
,
because
he
never
liked
meeting
the
clients
,
and
clearly
the
big
car
was
bringing
the
Crowninshield
twins
for
their
cruise-cure
.
Ellen
came
and
stood
beside
me
.
Our
usual
nervousness
about
meeting
clients
seemed
more
intense
this
bright
morning
for
neither
of
us
knew
quite
what
to
expect
of
the
senator
's
children
.
One
part
of
me
,
despite
George
Crowninshield
's
reassurances
,
anticipated
that
the
twins
would
emerge
as
shambling
twitching
wrecks
,
and
for
a
second
,
believing
my
worst
fears
,
I
bitterly
regretted
accepting
the
senator
's
charter
.
However
,
Rickie
Crowninshield
appeared
reassuringly
normal
when
he
emerged
from
the
limousine
.
At
the
very
least
I
had
expected
him
to
be
physically
frail
and
mentally
chastened
;
a
boy
worn
out
by
his
long
addiction
and
frightened
of
the
criminal
charges
that
hung
over
him
,
but
instead
he
came
out
of
the
limo
and
down
the
dock
with
the
frisky
energy
of
a
puppy
.
He
ran
across
the
gangplank
as
enthusiastically
as
though
he
sought
votes
for
his
father
's
election
campaign
,
then
approached
us
with
an
outstretched
hand
and
a
voice
full
of
bright
greetings
.
"

His
handshake
was
warm
and
firm
,

his
face
redolent
of
his
father
's
sincerity
.
"

"
He
gave
her
an
admiring
grin
that
was
very
reminiscent
of
the
senator
's
beguiling
charm
.
"
Hello
.
"
Ellen
's
manner
was
almost
British
in
its
cool
restraint
,
matching
our
welcome
which
we
had
deliberately
pitched
at
a
low
key
.
We
were
not
filling
the
marina
with
the
steel
band
jollity
of
Yellow
Bird
,
nor
were
any
of
us
in
our
matching
blue
and
white
uniforms
,
for
this
was
not
a
usual
charter
,
and
none
of
us
were
at
Rickie
or
Robin-Anne
Crowninshield
's
beck
and
call
.
Instead
,
if
we
were
anything
,
we
were
their
jailers
.
I
introduced
Rickie
to
McIllvanney
who
screwed
his
face
into
what
he
thought
was
a
pleasant
smile
then
,
after
exchanging
an
inanity
or
two
,
fled
to
his
office
.
"

boat

Rickie
looked
appreciatively
round
Wavebreaker
's
deck
.
He
sucked
on
a
cigarette
and
I
saw
that
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
were
stained
a
deep
yellow
by
the
nicotine
.
"

I

"

Rickie
said
,
but
referring
to
what
I
could
not
tell
.
He
was
built
like
a
basketball
player
;
tall
and
as
thin
as

insect
.
I
noticed
a
slight
discolouration
in
his
left
eye
that
betrayed
its
blindness
,
but
otherwise
he
looked
as
fit
as
a
cricket
.
He
had
his
father
's
black
hair
,
a
strong
sun-tan
,
and
seemed
filled
with
a
manic
energy
;
ready
and
eager
to
enjoy
both
Wavebreaker
and
our
company
.
"

turned
as

aboard

a
heavy
scuba
outfit
.
"

Thessy
,
forced
to
put
the
scuba
outfit
down
to
shake
Rickie
's
hand
,
stammered
that
he
did
not
mind
what
he
was
called
,
but
Rickie
had
already
forgotten
his
question
.
"

He
shouted
towards
a
black

was
walking
slowly
along
the
dock

The
man
who
now
approached
Wavebreaker
was
as
tall
as
Rickie
Crowninshield
,
but
,
where
Rickie
was
attenuated
,
this
man
was
as
broad
shouldered
and
as
heavily
muscled

bull

this
man
appeared
to
have
none

Maggot

casual
bonhomie

was
in
his
forties

he
had
a
hard
face
with
small
wary
eyes

tightly
curled
hair

was
cut
very
short

her
,
then
I
looked
at
her
companion
who
was
a
very
crisp
and
handsome
black
woman
.
"
My
name
's
Breakspear
,

I
introduced
myself
.
"
Denise
Harriman

she
responded

aides

"
"
She
's
from
Washington
,
"
the
manic
Rickie
explained
,
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
suggested
I
should
be
impressed
.
"
She
had
to
deliver
us
here
,
but
she
ai
n't
coming
with
us
because
she
gets
seasick
.
Ai
n't
that
right
,
Denise
?
You
barf
in
boats
?
"
Rickie
began
mimicking
an
attack
of
vomiting
.
"
I
do
n't
just
barf
on
boats
.
"
Denise
Harriman
shot
Rickie
a
look
of
pure
venom
.
The
sarcasm
went
airily
past
Rickie
who
had
suddenly
stiffened
,
and
whose
face
now
showed
a
look
of
the
most
terrible
anxiety
.
I
dreaded
to
discover
just
what
symptom
of
drug
dependency
I
was
witnessing
,
and
wondered
if
I
should
shout
for
the
big
Jackson
Chatterton
to
come
and
rescue
me
,
but
then
Rickie
turned
his
terrified
gaze
on
to
me
.
"
Jesus
!
"
He
punched
one
hand
into
the
other
.
"
My
dad
promised
to
ask
you
a
question
,
but
he
forgot
,
and
Mom
could
n't
remember
.
Shit
!
"
He
was
clearly
so
fearful
of
the
answer
to
his
father
's
unasked
question
that
he
scarcely
dared
pose
it
himself
,
but
then
summoned
up
the
courage
.
"
Does
this
boat
have
a
sound
system
,
Nick
?
"
I
nodded
.
"
Sure
.
We
've
got
a
tape
deck
and
a
CD
player
.
"
His
relief
was
palpable
.
"
Really
?
A
CD
?
Oh
God
,
that
's
awesome
!
Come
on
,
Robbie
!
"
His
good
spirits
thus
restored
,
Rickie
seized
his
sister
's
hand
and
dragged
her
excitedly
towards
the
boat
.
Robin-Anne
,
who
had
been
looking
very
apprehensive
,
seemed
to
go
aboard
Wavebreaker
rather
unwillingly
.
Denise
Harriman
,
the
senator
's
aide
,
uttered
a
barely
audible
sigh
which
I
translated
as
an
expression
of
relief
that
her
responsibility
for
the
twins
was
ending
.
She
took
a
thick
manila
envelope
from
her
attache
case
.
"
That
envelope
contains
the
twins
"
documentation
,
Mr
Breakspear
:
their
passports
,
emergency
air
tickets
and
medical
records
.
There
s
also
a
full
list
of
the
senator
's
telephone
numbers
.
"
She
handed
me
that
envelope
,
then
took
another
from
the
briefcase
.
"
And
these
are
the
papers
concerning
your
own
boat
.
"
She
opened
the
envelope
and
handed
me
the
forms
which
would
be
needed
if
the
senator
undertook
the
repairs
to
Masquerade
.
For
the
moment
my
boat
was
staying
on
Straker
's
Cay
,
and
she
would
only
pass
into
the
senator
's
care
if
I
agreed
to
extend
the
trial
two
weeks
,
cruise-cure
into
a
full
summer
's
excursion
.
I
spread
the
forms
on
the
saddle
of
McIllvanney
's
Kawasaki
.
If
I
did
take
the
twins
away
all
summer
then
Masquerade
would
be
taken
to
a
boatyard
in
Florida
,
so
I
now
signed
the
necessary
customs
forms
and
the
insurance
waiver
and
the
dozen
other
pieces
of
paper
that
would
be
needed
to
keep
the
United
States
government
and
the
delivery
company
happy
.
I
signed
the
last
sheet
,
hoped
to
God
that
the
US
Customs
service
did
not
discover
the
huge
Webley
pistol
deep
in
its
box
in
Masquerade
's
bilges
,
and
handed
Denise
Harriman
back
her
pen
.
She
put
the
signed
papers
in
her
attache
case
,
then
shot
a
poisonous
glance
towards
Rickie
who
was
rummaging
though
his
pile
of
luggage
on
Wavebreaker
's
deck
.
"
Bun
voyage
,
"
she
called
aloud
to
him
,
and
it
was
possible
to
discern
a
dance
of
relieved
joy
in
her
step
as
she
walked
back
to
the
limousine
.
Bellybutton
,
painting
his
delicate
silver
star
,
laughed
up
at
the
twins
with
his
discoloured
teeth
,
while
McIllvanney
leered
at
them
from
his
office
window
.
The
last
of
their
luggage
was
brought
from
the
limousine
and
,
as
Thessy
and
I
prepared
to
cast
off
,
Rickie
tested
our
sound
system
with
a
cacophonous
cassette
of
rock
music
.
Robin-Anne
searched
for
a
silent
dark
hole
in
which
to
hide
,
Jackson
Chatterton
scowled
at
us
,
Ellen
looked
exasperated
and
Thessy
appeared
just
plain
scared
.
I
started
Wavebreaker
's
engines
,
used
the
bow
thruster
to
drive
her
stem
away
from
the
quay
and
,
with
an
apparent
cargo
of
misery
and
mania
,
went
to
sea
.
We
beat
southwards
all
that
first
day
,
slicing
through
a
glittering
sea
,
and
propelled
by
an
apparently
changeless
south-easterly
trade
wind
.
We
hardly
saw
the
Crowninshield
twins
.
They
briefly
appeared
on
deck
for
lunch
;
a
meal
which
Rickie
hardly
touched
,
while
Robin-Anne
,
despite
her
apparent
frailty
,
attacked
the
sandwiches
and
salad
with
the
savagery
of
a
starving
bear
.
Afterwards
,
incongruously
dressed
in
a
raincoat
,
she
went
to
the
bows
and
stared
briefly
down
at
the
mesmerising
onrush
of
sea
where
it
split
and
foamed
at
Wavebreaker
's
cutwater
.
She
did
not
stay
there
long
,
but
retreated
from
the
fierce
sun
to
the
stern-cabin
that
she
would
be
sharing
with
Ellen
.
The
contrast
between
the
two
American
girls
was
almost
painful
;
Ellen
was
so
healthy
and
strong
,
while
the
waif-like
Robin-Anne
was
pathetically
wan
and
listless
.
"
What
do
you
think
of
her
?
"
I
asked
Ellen
that
afternoon
.
Ellen
gave
me
an
amused
glance
.
"
Little
Orphan
Annie
?
It
's
hard
to
believe
she
's
about
to
be
worth
six
million
dollars
.
Still
,
she
's
got
precious
little
else
going
for
her
.
"
I
smiled
at
the
severity
of
Ellen
's
judgment
.
"
Is
she
that
bad
?
"
"
She
has
a
distressingly
simple
mind
,
with
only
room
for
a
single
idea
at
any
one
time
.
Presently
that
idea
is
cocaine
,
and
nothing
but
cocaine
.
She
has
an
obsession
with
the
drug
that
verges
on
monomania
.
She
tells
me
she
needs
to
understand
it
if
she
's
going
to
defeat
it
.
"
"
Do
n't
you
approve
of
that
?
"
"
I
think
she
'd
do
better
to
understand
herself
,
"
Ellen
said
tartly
.
"
She
allowed
a
man
to
persuade
her
into
taking
the
drug
,
so
she
can
only
blame
herself
for
her
predicament
.
She
'd
find
it
more
useful
to
understand
her
own
character
short-comings
than
to
take
an
elementary
course
in
drug
chemistry
.
"
"
What
do
you
make
of
Rickie

I
asked
.
"

Ellen
said
scornfully
,
"

jock

a
great
deal
more
handsome

She
laughed
at
the
suspicion

jealousy
in
my
voice

"

"
At
supper
,
as
at
lunch
,
Robin-Anne
ate
with
the
appetite
of
a
horse
,
though
her
brother
hardly
touched
his
chicken
and
pasta
salad
.
"
Do
n't
you
like
pasta
?
"
Ellen
,
who
was
perversely
proud
of
her
skills
in
the
salad
department
,
asked
Rickie
with
just
a
touch
of
asperity
.
"
It
's
great
.
Really
awesome
.
"
Rickie
lit
a
cigarette
.
"
I
just
guess
I
'm
not
hungry
.
"
Robin-Anne
reached
over
and
tipped
her
brother
's
food
on
to
her
own
plate
.
"
Kind
of
starving
,
"
she
justified
her
theft
,
then
poured
herself
some
diet
soda
.
For
once
we
were
carrying
neither
wine
nor
spirits
on
Wavebreaker
,
for
Jackson
Chatterton
's
drug
clinic
had
utterly
forbidden
us
to
offer
the
twins
any
alcohol
,
saying
that
any
mood-altering
drug
could
hamper
the
success
of
a
detoxification
programme
.
We
were
thus
officially
a
dry
boat
,
though
I
had
hidden
some
Irish
whiskey
in
the
engine
room
,
and
I
was
sure
that
Ellen
would
have
similarly
salted
away
some
vodka
.
It
seemed
that
Ellen
and
I
were
not
the
only
ones
to
take
such
a
precaution
,
for
late
that
night
Jackson
Chatterton
lumbered
on
deck
with
a
bottle
in
one
huge
hand
.
"
Bourbon

he
explained
laconically
.
"
Want
some

"
"
I
thought
you
'd
never
ask
.
"
He
chuckled
,
produced
two
cardboard
cups
,
and
poured
me
a
generous
slug
of
the
whiskey
.
We
were
alone
on
deck
,
though
not
the
only
ones
awake
for
I
could
hear
Rickie
and
Ellen
's
voices
coming
from
the
open
skylight
of
the
main
saloon
.
I
hoped
Thessy
was
fast
asleep
for
he
would
be
taking
the
morning
watch
.
"
Cheers
,
"
I
said
.
Chatterton
raised
his
cardboard
cup
in
silent
acknowledgement
,
then
stared
ahead
to
where
a
great
beam
swept
around
the
sky
.
"
A
lighthouse
?
"
he
asked
in
a
voice
which
suggested
that
a
prudent
man
avoided
such
things
.
I
nodded
.
"
It
's
called
the
Hole
in
the
Wall

Once
we
're
past
it

turn
out
to

open
ocean

"
I
had
spoken
enthusiastically
,
but
Jackson
Chatterton
seemed
unmoved
by
the
prospect
.
"
What
are
your
plans
?
"
he
asked
me
.
I
had
nothing
particular
planned
,
merely
an
idea
that
it
might
be
interesting
to
thrash
our
way
out
into
the
open
ocean
,
though
,
mindful
of
the
danger
of
tropical
storms
,
I
had
no
intention
of
going
too
far
from
the
safe
shelter
of
a
Bahamian
hurricane
hole
.
But
I
fancied
feeling
the
long
hard
pressure
of
ocean
waves
against
our
hull
and
,
though
we
were
short-handed
,
I
reckoned
that
a
few
days
out
of
sight
of
land
would
shake
us
all
down
quickly
.
I
explained
all
that
to
Chatterton
,
but
stressed
that
we
would
run
for
cover
at
the
first
sign
of
trouble
.
He
must
have
assumed
that
I
meant
trouble
from
the
twins
,
for
he
suddenly
became
surprisingly
loquacious
.
"
They
wo
n't
give
you
any
grief
in
the
next
few
days
,
"
he
said
.
"
Now
that
they
ca
n't
get
hold
of
cocaine
they
'll
just
crash
out
.
"
I
grimaced
.
"
Does
that
mean
they
'll
be
seeing
green
monkeys
and
blue
snakes
up
the
rigging
?
"
Chatterton
poured
himself
more
bourbon
,
then
put
the
bottle
within
my
reach
on
the
binnacle
shelf
.
"
Coming
off
cocaine
is
n't
like
that
.
At
first
they
'll
just
want
to
do
nothing
but
eat
and
sleep
.
It
's
the
opposite
of
a
cocaine
high
,
you
see
.
"
He
paused
.
"
The
difficult
bit
starts
two
or
three
days
later
.
That
's
when
the
real
hell
begins
.
"
"
For
all

us

"

he
said
grimly
,
and
I
was
suddenly
rather
glad
to
have
the
taciturn
Chatterton
aboard
.
The
big
man
had
obviously
come
on
deck
to
warn
me
what
to
expect
from
the
twins
,
and
for
that
I
was
grateful
.

I
said

Chatterton
nodded
.
"
Rickie
may
have
stopped
his
cocaine

day

two
ago

The

laughed

avoiding

one

chance
is
by
proving
to

's
cleaned
up
his

he
does

Chatterton
had
spoken
with
genuine

glanced
up
at
the
sails

down
at

ahead

I
guessed

did
not

Instead
I
asked
whether
the
American

By
midnight
I
was
alone
on
deck
,
and
happy
to
be
alone
.
I
like
sailing
alone
at
night
.
I
like
to
watch
the
phosphorescence
curling
away
from
the
hull
and
I
like
to
watch
the
brilliant
specks
of
light
fade
in
the
black
deep
water
far
in
the
ship
's
wake
.
I
like
to
be
alone
under
the
careless
profusion
of
the
stars
,
and
alone
on
a
moon-glossed
sea
.
I
like
the
sounds
of
a
boat
sailing
at
night
.
The
sounds
are
the
same
as
those
of
daylight
,
yet
somehow
the
night
magnifies
and
sharpens
the
creak
of
a
yielding
block
,
the
sigh
of
air
over
a
shroud
,
the
stretching
of
a
sail
,
the
hiss
of
water
sliding
sleek
against
the
hull
,
the
curl
of
a
quarter-wave
falling
away
,
and
the
thump
as
a
wave
strikes
the
cutwater
to
be
sheared
into
two
bright
slices
of
whiteness
.
I
like
the
purposefulness
of
a
boat
at
night
as
it
slits
a
path
across
an
empty
planet
.
I
like
the
secretiveness
of
a
boat
in
the
blackness
,
when
the
only
thing
to
dislike
is
the
prospect
of
dawn
,
which
seems
like
a
betrayal
because
,
at
night
,
in
a
boat
under
sail
,
it
is
easy
to
feel
very
close
to
God
-
for
eternity
is
all
around
.
I
tacked
the
ship
shortly
after
midnight
,
doing
the
job
by
myself
and
enjoying
the
work
.
Ellen
was
still
awake
,
talking
in
the
stateroom
with
Rickie
,
but
everyone
else
seemed
asleep
.
I
wished
that
Ellen
and
Rickie
would
go
to
their
beds
,
for
the
soft
mutter
of
their
voices
was
an
intrusion
on
the
dark
and
star-studded
infinity
through
which
I
steered
Wavebreaker
.
I
had
just
winched
in
the
staysail
's
port
sheet
when
the
explosion
sounded
,
or
something
so
like
an
explosion
that
I
instinctively
cowered
by
Wavebreaker
's
rail
as
my
mind
whipped
back
to
the
crash
of
practice
shells
ripping
through
the
sleet
in
Norway
.
The
sound
of
the
explosion
melded
into
a
terrible
noise
that
was
like
an
animal
dying
in
awful
,
bellowing
pain
,
but
beneath
that
sound
of
agony
was
a
harsh
metallic
scrape
and
clash
that
punched
at
my
belly
and
eardrums
.
If
anything
the
sound
seemed
to
become
louder
as
I
ran
down
the
deck
.
The
noise
was
a
foul
but
apt
accompaniment
to
the
schooner
's
fitful
motion
for
,
with
her
wheel
lashed
and
her
sails
only
half
trimmed
,
Wavebreaker
was
bridling
and
jerking
into
the
short
hard
seas
that
were
driving
through
the
North-East
Providence
Channel
.
The
noise
rose
to
a
scream
;
like
the
sound
that
a
beast
would
make
while
being
disembowelled
.
I
stepped
over
the
coaming
and
down
into
the
cockpit
where
I
cannoned
off
the
binnacle
before
snatching
open
the
companionway
hatch
.
I
put
both
hands
on
the
rails
and
vaulted
down
to
the
accommodation
deck
.
I
slipped
as
I
landed
and
fell
against
the
bulkhead
.
I
scrambled
up
and
reached
for
the
eject
button
on
the
cassette
deck
.
I
punched
the
button
and
was
rewarded
with
a
blessed
,
ear-ringing
silence
as
the
offending
cassette
slid
out
.
"
Shit

Rickie
,
apparently
still
vibrating
to
the
music

sprang
up
from
the
stateroom
couch
.

was
grinning
from

couch

amusement

an
appalling
din
at
such
volume

such
a
late
hour

hit
me

called
warningly
.
Some
grain
of
self-preserving
sense
must
have
penetrated
Rickie
's
skull
,
for
he
suddenly
dropped
on
to
his
heels
and
offered
me
a
placatory
grin
.

turning
away

thus
leaving

blind
eye
facing
me

fumbled

stooped

up

Jackson
Chatterton
had
appeared
in
canary
yellow
pyjamas
at
the
far
end
of
the
stateroom
.
His
looming
presence
utterly
cowed
Rickie
who
whined
something
about
only
wanting
to
play
Ellen
a
little
night
music
,
and
that
he
had
not
meant
any
harm
,
and
what
was
a
guy
supposed
to
be
doing
on
this
boat
anyway
?
It
was
n't
the
goddamn
navy
,
really
,
and
he
went
on
muttering
all
the
way
past
Chatterton
's
impassive
gaze
and
so
into
the
cabin
that
the
two
of
them
shared
.
Thessy
's
scared
face
appeared
at
the
other
cabin
door
,
but
I
shook
my
head
at
him
,
mimicked
sleep
,
and
he
ducked
back
inside
.
"
Sorry

Ellen
said
,
though
not
with
any
great
contrition
.
"
Forget
it

I
was
still
angry
,
but
there
was
no
point
in
pursuing
what
was
over
,
so
I
went
back
topsides
to
trim
the
ship
,
and
five
minutes
later
I
saw
the
stateroom
lights
go
out
,
and
half
an
hour
after
that
the
lights
in
Ellen
and
Robin-Anne
's
cabin
were
doused
,
leaving
only
a
light
in
the
forward
starboard
cabin
to
show
that
either
Rickie
or
Jackson
Chatterton
was
still
awake
.
I
wondered
if
they
had
simply
forgotten
to
turn
off
the
bulb
which
annoyingly
cast
its
brightness
through
a
porthole
and
on
to
the
swirl
and
rush
of
white
water
,
and
I
was
half
tempted
to
pull
the
fuse
out
of
the
circuit
and
thus
surround
Wavebreaker
with
darkness
,
but
resisted
the
impulse
.
The
night
became
quiet
again
.
Wavebreaker
settled
on
her
new
course
and
,
by
the
time
the
small
hours
were
growing
,
we
had
left
the
island
's
lights
well
behind
and
I
was
cutting
her
prow
hard
into
real
ocean
waves
.
We
were
on
the
starboard
tack
,
fighting
into
the
trades
as
we
clawed
our
way
out
from
the
Bahamian
shoals
into
the
deep
waters
of
the
Atlantic
.
The
difference
in
Wavebreaker
's
motion
was
extraordinary
.
She
had
disdained
the
smaller
waves
in
the
shelter
of
the
islands
,
but
now
she
seemed
to
tremble
as
her
hull
soaked
up
the
ponderous
force
of
the
ocean
.
This
was
proper
sailing
.
And
,
as
if
to
celebrate
her
freedom
,
she
dipped
her
cutwater
into
a
sudden
trough
of
the
sea
and
then
sprayed
white
water
high
over
her
bows
.
The
shudder
of
the
bigger
wave
sent
a
shock
wave
through
the
long
hull
,
and
I
laughed
aloud
with
the
pleasure
of
it
.
Then
,
as
I
often
did
when
I
was
alone
at
sea
,
I
began
to
recite
Shakespeare
.
I
knew
reams
of
the
stuff
,
yards
and
yards
of
it
,
learned
from
my
father
;
the
one
absolutely
true
gift
of
my
childhood
.
I
liked
to
hear
the
verse
,
and
enjoyed
declaiming
it
,
but
only
if
there
was
no
one
to
hear
me
,
for
I
knew
that
my
voice
held
all
the
fine
cadences
of
Sir
Tom
himself
.
That
night
I
belted
out
one
of
my
favourite
speeches
,
the
one
from
the
second
part
of
Henry
IV
in
which
the
new
king
,
Henry
V
,
rejects
the
friendship
of
Falstaff
.
I
know
thee
not
,
old
man
:
fall
to
thy
prayers
;
How
ill
white
hairs
become
a
fool
and
jester
!
I
have
long
dream
'd
of
such
a
kind
of
man
,
So
surfeit-swell
'd
,
so
old
,
and
so
profane
;
But
,
being
awaked
,
I
do
despise
my
dream
.
I
stopped
abruptly
.
A
movement
had
startled
me
and
I
turned
to
see
Robin-Anne
Crowninshield
,
dressed
only
in
a
white
nightdress
,
standing
in
the
main
companionway
.
"
That
was
really
great
,
"
she
said
.
She
was
shivering
violently
.
"

the
locker

foot

I
said
,
"

'll

I
like
mine

sugar

with
milk

have
to
unscrew
the
stove-fiddles

release
the
Thermos

the
milk

"
She
nodded
grave
acknowledgement
of
all
my
instructions
,
then
disappeared
below
for
five
minutes
,
eventually
returning
swathed
in
one
of
the
vast
,
padded
and
multi-layered
foul-weather
coats
,
and
carrying
a
mug
of
coffee
.
"
I

it
's
caffeinated

she
asked
in
her
thin
voice
.
"

I
confirmed
,
"

She
sat
at
the
edge
of
the
cockpit
,
curled
her
legs
into
the
warm
shelter
of
the
jacket
,
then
hunched
down
into
the
thick
collar
so
that
all
I
could
see
of
her
face
was
her
enormous
,
moon-silvered
and
lemur-like
eyes
beneath
the
pale
gleam
of
her
short
bright
hair
.
She
yawned
.
"

set

She
rested
her
head
against
a
cushion
so
that
she
could
stare
straight
up
through
the
network
of
rigging
and
past
the
light-blanched
sails
to
where
the
stars
wheeled
their
cold
fire
beyond
the
mastheads

She
shook
her
head
,
then
seemed
to
shrink
even
lower
inside
the
enveloping
jacket
.
"

I
had

instead
she
frowned
as

my
happiness
was
a

needed
to
be

suddenly
pushed
into
my

I
could
feel
all
the
thudding
pressure
of
the
sea
and
the
wind
concentrated
into
that
one
polished
spoke

I
eased
the
wheel
up
,
drawing
Wavebreaker
's
bows
harder
into
the
sea

wind
,
and
I
was
rewarded
with
another
shattering
of
white
spray
that
exploded
prettily
about
our
bows
before
I
let
the
hull
fall
away
once
more

laughed
for
the
sheer
pleasure
of
playing
such
games
with
God
's
strong

remembered
the
senator
had
told
me
that

liked
to

asked
her
if

wanted

spoke
sadly

a

really
was
a

of
lost
innocence
,

I
suppose

there

nodded
very
earnestly

truly

my
embarrassment

a
swift
and
flippant
response

could
think

nothing

brain
is
screaming
for
more
dopamine

so
you
overdose
because
you
ca
n't
accept
that
the
drug
is
n't
working
any
longer
,
and
it
's
then
that
cocaine
starts
doing
its
other
things
to
you
.
It
shrinks
the
arteries
,

that
's
what
blinded
Rickie
's
left
eye

I
really
had
nothing
useful
to
say
,
so
I
responded
with
a
sympathetic
noise
that
only
made
Robin-Anne
shake
her
head
impatiently
.
"
There
's
worse

she
said
,
"
far
worse
.
"
"
You

a
heart
attack
?
"
"
No
-
"
She
drew
the
word
out
,
so
that
I
heard
in
its
simple
syllable
all
the
pain
and
hurt
of
the
drug
.
Robin-Anne
had
been
staring
at
the
dark
sea
,
but
now
she
turned
her
big
eyes
back
to
me
.
"
The
worst
thing
about
cocaine
is
that
once
it
has
exhausted
all
the
dopamine
from
the
brain
,
then
what
's
left
is
a
black
hole
of
depression
so
big
and
so
awful
that
not
all
the
misery
in
the
world
can
fill
it
.
People
try
to
beat
that
misery
with
barbiturates
,
but
nothing
can
cure
it
because
you
've
taken
away
from
yourself
all
chance
of
feeling
pleasure
.
The
doctors
have
a
word
for
that
misery
;
they
call
it
anhedonia
,
which
only
means
an
inability
to
feel
enjoyment
,
and
that
's
what
it
is
,
but
it
feels
like
hell
,
like
true
hell
,
and
it
's
a
hell
you
ca
n't
even
escape
from
in
sleep
because
overdosing
on
cocaine
gives
you
chronic
insomnia
.
"
Hell
was
being
without
God
,
I
thought
,
but
I
said
nothing
,
just
stared
instead
at
the
white
wash
of
cabin
light
on
the
rushing
water
,
and
I
wondered
why
some
people
could
take
cocaine
and
just
walk
away
from
it
,
while
others
ended
up
in
hell
,
or
in
a
peep-show
which
was
probably
the
same
thing
.
"
Of
course
,
"
Robin-Anne
went
on
,
"
the
brain
eventually
manufactures
more
dopamine
,
so
after
a
day
or
two
the
cocaine
can
work
again
,
and
you
go
soaring
up
from
hell
into
heaven
.
It
's
a
roller-coaster
,
Mr
Breakspear
,
up
and
down
,
up
and
down
"
-
her
thin
white
hand
suited
the
action
to
her
words
-
"
from
heaven
to
hell
and
back
again
,
and
if
heaven
is
euphoria
then
let
me
assure
you
that
hell
is
a
terrible
place

I
said

though
I
really
could
help
her
with
my
tuppence
worth
of
cheerful
encouragement
,

perhaps
that
will
stop
you
ever
going

it

"
But
there
's
another
kind

Robin-Anne
's
voice
was
dulled
,
as
though
my
cheap
optimism
had
depressed
her
,
"
which
is
remembering
the
euphoria
,
and
having
to
surrender
the
means
of
creating
it
.
That
hell
is
giving
up
cocaine
.
I
'm
in
the
easy
stage
,
the
first
few
days
when
you
just
sleep
and
eat
,
but
quite
soon
I
'll
be
in
the
hell
of
denial
,
Mr
Breakspear
.
"
I
looked
past
Robin-Anne
to
where
the
moon
's
path
gleamed
on
the
long
waves
,
and
then
I
glanced
forward
and
saw
another
belt
of
silver
,
but
this
one
diffuse
and
hazy
,
showing
where
the
first
crepuscular
light
seeped
over
the
world
's
grey
edge
.
"
Dawn
,
"
I
said
in
a
hopeful
voice
.
But
Robin-Anne
did
not
react
,
and
I
looked
down
to
see
that
she
was
not
watching
for
the
new
day
,
but
was
crying
.
I
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
do
.
I
should
have
knelt
beside
her
and
put
my
arms
around
her
and
promised
her
that
she
would
be
freed
from
the
hell
of
anhedonia
,
and
that
there
really
was
a
God
and
that
she
did
have
the
strength
to
tear
herself
free
from
cocaine
,
as
others
had
freed
themselves
,
and
I
should
have
assured
her
that
there
was
true
happiness
without
a
drug
,
but
I
did
not
know
her
well
enough
to
embrace
her
,
so
I
just
let
her
weep
as
the
sun
streaked
up
in
glory
from
the
east
.
Thus
Wavebreaker
sailed
towards
the
light
,
carrying
her
passengers
to
hell
.
I
rousted
Thessy
out
of
his
bed
with
a
cup
of
tea
,
then
went
to
my
own
bed
as
he
took
over
the
wheel
.
I
slept
,
dreaming
of
Masquerade
sinking
through
waves
of
steel
into
torrents
of
fire
.
I
woke
just
before
lunchtime
to
find
Wavebreaker
still
sailing
eastwards
.
Ellen
was
showing
Rickie
Crowninshield
all
the
elaborate
electronic
toys
that
only
Ellen
wholly
understood
;
the
radios
,
radars
,
weatherfaxes
and
satellite
receivers
,
and
Rickie
was
being
surprisingly
attentive
,
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
scowled
and
clamped
a
pair
of
headphones
over
his
ears
as
though
to
make
sure
that
he
did
not
have
to
hold
any
kind
of
conversation
with
me
.
Ellen
shrugged
at
his
rudeness
.
"
How
's
the
weather
?
"
I
asked
her
.
"
No
change
.
"
I
squinted
through
a
porthole
and
saw
the
sky
was
scraped
blue
and
bright
above
an
empty
sea
.
"
You
faxed
a
chart
?
"
I
asked
Ellen
.
"
Sure
did
.
"
She
handed
me
the
sheet
of
grey
paper
with
its
synoptic
chart
which
had
been
transmitted
from
Florida
just
a
few
moments
before
.
I
pretended
to
despise
such
modern
aids
,
but
that
was
really
a
defensive
reaction
because
I
knew
I
could
never
afford
such
frills
for
Masquerade
.
I
saw
that
there
was
not
even
a
ripple
of
low
pressure
off
to
the
east
,
which
was
the
reassurance
I
wanted
,
for
a
depression
to
the
east
could
swiftly
twist
itself
into
a
full-blooded
storm
.
"
Good
morning
,
Rickie
,
"
I
said
loudly
,
wanting
to
demonstrate
that
I
held
no
grudge
for
his
behaviour
in
the
night
.
"
Yo
.
"
His
voice
was
surly
,
but
suddenly
he
twisted
round
to
face
me
and
took
off
the
headphones
,
and
I
thought
he
was
going
to
apologise
for
his
rudeness
of
the
previous
night
,
but
instead
he
demanded
to
know
if
it
was
true
that
we
were
out
in
the
open
ocean
and
were
not
planning
to
make
a
landfall
for
some
days
.
"
That
's
true
,
"
I
said
.
"
But
I
wanted
to
do
some
scuba
!
"
he
said
in
outrage
.
"
There
'll
be
a
chance
,
I
promise
.
"
"
Jesus
!
"
he
said
in
exasperation
,
then
turned
abruptly
away
.
I
waited
to
see
if
he
would
say
any
more
,
but
he
evidently
did
not
want
my
company
.
I
grimaced
at
Ellen
,
then
went
topsides
where
I
found
the
ship
being
steered
by
its
automatic
pilot
and
Thessy
and
Jackson
Chatterton
perched
halfway
up
the
mainmast
with
reels
of
rigging
wire
from
which
Thessy
was
fashioning
a
parallel
set
of
starboard
shrouds
.
I
wanted
to
double
up
all
Wavebreaker
's
standing
rigging
,
just
in
case
we
did
try
to
take
her
across
the
ocean
.
There
was
no
sign
of
Robin-Anne
who
was
presumably
asleep
.
Chatterton
climbed
down
to
the
deck
and
told
me
that
Robin-Anne
had
eaten
a
huge
breakfast
.
"
What
about
Rickie
?
"
"
He
just
played
with
his
food
,
"
Chatterton
frowned
,
"
and
that
means
he
must
be
over
the
crash
period
,
which
means
his
behaviour
's
going
to
be
difficult
.
"
"
Even

asked
with
dread

The
big
man
laughed

It
seemed
that
Jackson
Chatterton
was
right

we
were
all
witnesses
to
a
dreadful
metamorphosis
in
Rickie
.
When
he
had
joined
the
ship
he
had
been
nothing
but
eagerness
and
smiles
,
romping
about
like
a
new
puppy
,
but
now
he
had
turned
unrelentingly
morose
.
At
lunchtime
he
scowled
at
his
sister
who
,
wrapped
in
a
dressing
gown
,
fell
on
the
sandwiches
as
though
she
had
not
eaten
in
weeks
.

Rickie
would
not
even
try
a
sandwich
,
but
instead
pushed
his
plate
away
and
lit
a
cigarette
.
He
sipped
at
his
can
of
diet
soda
and
grimaced
at
the
taste
.
"

merely
annoyed

stared
at
his
sister
whose
pale
face
was
made
even
paler
by
the
sun-block
ointment
she
had
liberally
smeared
on
her
skin
.
"

Robin-Anne
nodded

was
too
busy
eating

take
much
notice
of
her
brother

she
did
manage
to
mumble

Rickie
suddenly
asked

serious
enquiry

did
not
answer

everyone

Robin-Anne

was
too
busy
eating

seemed
embarrassed

Once
again
the
lack
of
response
infuriated
Rickie
who
,
seeking
some
other
means
of
provocation
,
hurled
his
can
of
soda
across
the
deck

"

shouted

Ellen
caught
my
eye

we
stared
at

a
sympathetic
fraction

a
second

I
looked
away
to
see

the
sticky
liquid
had
sprayed
across
the
teak
planks

up

mess
himself

waved
him
down

stolidly
on

why
are
we
out
here
?
I
want
to
see
a
beach
!
A
beach
,
you
know
what
a
beach
is
?
Sand
?
Surf
?
I
want
to
go
board-sailing
,
maybe
do
a
little
water
skiing
.
I
want
to
do
some
scuba
,
for
Christ
's
sake
!
"
I
ignored
him
,
fetching
instead
a
mop
and
bucket
from
one
of
the
big
stern
lockers
.
The
bucket
had
a
rope
attached
to
its
handle
and
I
skimmed
it
over
the
stern
to
haul
up
a
gallon
or
so
of
sea-water
which
I
slammed
down
in
front
of
Rickie
.
"
The
deck
needs
cleaning
,
Rickie
,
so
do
it
.
"
I
threw
the
mop
at
him
.
He
ignored
the
mop
,
just
staring
at
me
,
and
I
saw
him
take
a
breath
ready
to
defy
me
so
I
spoke
before
he
could
.
"
Either
you
clean
the
deck
,
Rickie
,
or
I
'll
scrub
it
with
your
hair
.
"
He
began
to
weep
.
Robin-Anne
glanced
at
him
,
then
smeared
mustard
on
a
roast
beef
sandwich
.
"
It
's
real
good
food
,
"
she
said
enthusiastically
.
"
I
'll
help
you
,
"
Ellen
said
to
Rickie
,
then
she
took
his
hand
and
placed
it
on
the
mop
handle
.
"
Come
on
,
"
she
said
gently
.
Thus
,
as
Rickie
feebly
dabbed
at
the
deck
and
as
his
sister
ate
,
our
happy
ship
sailed
on
.
